[00:00] michaelmartinez: I def didn't use -g flag when installing either
[00:00] hobodave: hmm exec doesn't seem to be working as I'd expect
[00:00] CoverSli1e: michaelmartinez: did you install npm using homebrew?
[00:00] rmttnmd has joined the channel
[00:00] michaelmartinez: I am not sure TBH I am however, on version 1.1.1
[00:02] hobodave: if I use a pipe in exec, it seems to wrap the whole thing in a /bin/sh -c and I don't get any data from the process.stdout
[00:03] ehazlett has joined the channel
[00:03] shedinja has joined the channel
[00:04] CoverSli1e: for exec you use a callback with error, stdout, and stderr as arguments
[00:04] hobodave: CoverSli1e right
[00:04] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[00:04] hobodave: oh, wait hmm
[00:05] chapel: michaelmartinez: check if there is a node_modules folder above the one you are in
[00:05] michaelmartinez: ok
[00:05] mattgifford has joined the channel
[00:05] hobodave: CoverSli1e but stdout.on("data", function(data) { … ]) is working for an exec'd process that doesn't pipe
[00:05] hobodave: is that expected?
[00:06] michaelmartinez: chapel: yeah there is... I was testing on the desktop and there is a shit load of them in there.
[00:06] michaelmartinez: They went to my /Users/name dir
[00:06] hobodave: oh I see an example using stout redirectino
[00:06] hobodave: let me try that
[00:07] chapel: well Ive found if there is a node_modules above the dir you are at, it can put them in there
[00:07] sorensen__ has joined the channel
[00:07] chapel: depends on how far, above, only one level that I have seen
[00:07] michaelmartinez: chapel: If def did that and now I know its done it waaaayyy more than one level
[00:07] michaelmartinez: \
[00:08] CoverSli1e: it's possible it walks all the way up to / looking for node_modules
[00:09] michaelmartinez: CoverSli1e: yeah... it walked a loooooong way. 
[00:09] michaelmartinez: How do I fix that?
[00:09] CoverSli1e: mkdir node_modules
[00:09] sorensen__ has joined the channel
[00:09] CoverSli1e: where you want it to go
[00:09] michaelmartinez: Fuck My Life. Thats it? I am giving myself a giant throat punch
[00:10] ramitos has joined the channel
[00:10] michaelmartinez: Thanks guys.... can I just move the modules in my User dir to where they belong?
[00:11] sammmy: Does bouncy and up interfere with eachother?
[00:11] chapel: michaelmartinez: I think its in the node docs as well
[00:11] sammmy: each other*
[00:11] CoverSli1e: yeah that should be fine
[00:11] chapel: http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders
[00:12] chapel: michaelmartinez: If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so on, until the root of the tree is reached.
[00:12] michaelmartinez: Yeah, RTFM. I followed several tuts and they made it sound lke the node_modules dir was created automagically
[00:13] michaelmartinez: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet#Installing_a_npm_package_locally
[00:14] michaelmartinez: Now I need to move like a hundred fucking modules.

[00:14] michaelmartinez: CoverSli1e: Gracias Tambien!
[00:15] context: what
[00:15] context: michaelmartinez: why not use a package.json like a real man and just do 'npm install'
[00:15] context: and let 100 modules get installed 'magically'
[00:15] michaelmartinez: lolwat?
[00:16] context: michaelmartinez: node_modules IS created automagically
[00:16] chapel: michaelmartinez: if you make a package.json file with dependencies
[00:16] chapel: you can do npm install in the dir, and it will handle the rest
[00:16] chapel: installing all the modules into the local node_modules folder
[00:17] Knowledge has joined the channel

[00:23] hobodave: stout redirection isn't working :-\
[00:23] michaelmartinez: ahhh ok
[00:23] hobodave: stupid autocorrect
[00:23] CoverSli1e: mmm stout
[00:23] chapel: also
[00:23] chapel: you can do npm install -s
[00:23] chapel: or --save maybe
[00:23] chapel: and it will put that in your package.json
[00:23] chapel: automagically
[00:24] isaacs: chapel: --save or -S
[00:24] isaacs: -s is --silen
[00:24] chapel: :)
[00:24] isaacs: --silent
[00:24] chapel: kk
[00:24] chapel: well I used --save

[00:25] hobodave: CoverSli1e can you see what is going on here? https://gist.github.com/2128946
[00:25] michaelmartinez: chapel: npm install <mod> --save vs. npm init ????
[00:26] hobodave: CoverSli1e when I pass a string search parameter to tail_start I never see the "grep STDOUT received data" message logged
[00:26] hobodave: but I see the process running
[00:26] hobodave: I see the tail message logged though
[00:26] CoverSli1e: hobodave: add grep.stdin.resume()
[00:26] hobodave: CoverSli1e where?

[00:27] achiu1 has joined the channel
[00:27] hobodave: CoverSli1e no change
[00:28] hobodave: same behavior
[00:28] CoverSli1e: hmm
[00:28] hobodave: this is remarkably similar to the example in the child_process docs
[00:28] hobodave: which I am following
[00:28] chapel: michaelmartinez: well npm init creates a package json for you
[00:29] chapel: npm install --save adds that module + version to the package.json
[00:29] Joeysomo has joined the channel
[00:29] isaacs: michaelmartinez: first init, then install --save
[00:30] michaelmartinez: awesome. thanks so much isaacs and chapel. everything I've wanted to do so far was global....
[00:30] isaacs: np
[00:30] isaacs: michaelmartinez: also, if you want to use the one that youv'e already installed globally, and you are not on windows, you can do `npm link modulename`
[00:30] michaelmartinez: and I thought npm ls was global hahahaha
[00:30] isaacs: michaelmartinez: there's no `npm link blah --save` yet, though
[00:31] fluk3 has joined the channel
[00:31] isaacs: michaelmartinez: you can do `npm ls --global`

[00:59] hobodave: which now that I test the example code directly, doesn't even remotely work

[02:27] isaacs: timoxley: it does one thing, reasonably well.
[02:27] timoxley: isaacs how do you feel about… npm?
[02:28] isaacs: timoxley: rimraf is also pretty nice in that it's a very well understood problem, so it's easy to use as an example.

[02:59] riven has joined the channel
[02:59] wdbl: well, not exactly but the problematic part happens in C++ - in SlowBuffer.makeFastBuffer where it fills the fast Buffer object's data.

[03:01] qsl1pknotp: Anyone here have a good tutorial on callbacks? 'cause i'm confused 
[03:01] ParadoxQuine: what is confusing you?
[03:02] qsl1pknotp: Well i'm using nowjs, and don't want the server to hang while waiting for user input, so if i make  a function
[03:02] alejandromg: qsl1pknotp: http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/nodejs-for-beginners-callbacks/4
[03:02] qsl1pknotp: everyone.now.bet = function(name,callback(err,result)){};
[03:02] qsl1pknotp: and then define the callback elsewhere, is that doing it right?
[03:03] ParadoxQuine: not quite. that link is probably good, i found this too http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4506240/help-understanding-the-concept-of-javascript-callbacks-with-node-js-especially
[03:03] qsl1pknotp: Ok thanks! gonna read 'em both
[03:03] wdbl: try this: everyone.now.bet = function(name, callback) { };
[03:03] alejandromg: btw that's not valid js 
[03:03] qsl1pknotp: what i just wrote?
[03:03] wdbl: and then define your callback as: function callback(err, result) { doStuff(); }
[03:04] alejandromg: try as wdbl said
[03:04] qsl1pknotp: Oooh ok sweet
[03:04] qsl1pknotp: and i don't have to pass the err/result because of the closure right?
[03:05] wdbl: whatever calls the callback should pass that stuff
[03:05] qsl1pknotp: sweet
[03:05] qsl1pknotp: thanks a lot :)
[03:07] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/reified/blob/master/lib/buffer.js
[03:07] benvie: I made a sort of middle ground buffer that works in the browser and node at a minimal level
[03:07] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[03:07] willwhite has joined the channel
[03:08] wdbl: nice benvie
[03:09] wdbl: can you give me an overview? are you using an array as the final backing data structure? how are you creating views on that?
[03:09] jakehow has joined the channel
[03:09] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[03:09] benvie: my lib isn't too far from being browser ready now
[03:09] wdbl: are you supporting square-bracket notation with that?
[03:09] andrewdeandrade has joined the channel
[03:10] Poetro has joined the channel
[03:10] benvie: it uses ArrayBuffer in the browser and a combination of tricks. It only provides indexed access for the first 20 indices which are the most common. Beyond that it provides a common API for reading and writing all the types using the same set of function names
[03:10] benvie: and it can fake a lot of the indexed stuff
[03:10] benvie: i could map more indices but it's not really needed
[03:10] k1ttty has joined the channel
[03:10] wdbl: ahh ok, but it's also a wrapper for Node's Buffer too, right? so, if your Node modules use that wrapper, they can run in the browser...correct?
[03:10] benvie: it provides the other apis which are more crucial
[03:10] benvie: yeah
[03:11] benvie: well
[03:11] benvie: yeah
[03:11] wdbl: if you update your wrapper buffer like: buffer[0] = 255; will it show up in the underlying SlowBuffer?
[03:11] benvie: it wraps node's buffer but it also doesn't automatically work with code not designed fro it
[03:11] Brandon_R: why does now.js have a limit at 6500 connections?
[03:11] benvie: in node it actually inherits directly from Buffer
[03:11] benvie: and has full indexed access
[03:11] benvie: it basically has everuthing a node buffer does
[03:11] benvie: and then some more
[03:12] wdbl: ahhhh ok and in the browser, you simply don't have views on an underlying buffer correct?
[03:12] benvie: since BuffBuffer.prototype.__proto__ = Buffer.prototype
[03:12] Brandon_R: shoudn't it be BuffBuffer.__proto__ ?
[03:12] wdbl: i couldn't figure out how to do multiple views to a single array in the browser
[03:12] benvie: in the browser it's going to be built primarily on a DataView combirnd with a Uint8Array
[03:13] wdbl: maybe using a string
[03:13] descipher has joined the channel
[03:13] benvie: no since I add new methods to it
[03:13] wdbl: ok i see. I'm working with a slightly more limited environment known as Microsoft's shitty jscript/ActiveScript engine
[03:13] benvie: I have my the prototype as a new object inheriting from Buffer.prototype
[03:13] Brandon_R: oh\
[03:13] benvie: ah if you're not even working with ArrayBuffers
[03:14] wdbl: string, right?
[03:14] benvie: you need to do out all the types of data types basically
[03:14] benvie: yeah
[03:14] benvie: I mean the API can work with it but that's a lot more work
[03:14] benvie: it's primarily based around the methods
[03:14] wdbl: my reason for using jscript/ActiveScript is that I am executing it all within a C# app
[03:14] benvie: write/Read Int8, Uint8, etc.
[03:14] benvie: plus the most important convenience methods
[03:14] pradeepbv has joined the channel
[03:14] benvie: slice, clone, fill, copy
[03:15] infynyxx has joined the channel
[03:15] benvie: it can all be emulated using strings
[03:15] ppppaul has joined the channel
[03:15] benvie: it'll just be slow
[03:15] benvie: and you need the math stuff to support the various types
[03:16] benvie: I do have some stuff like that, the BitfieldType has to use bitwise operators in order to read and write at the bit level
[03:16] wdbl: this limitation might actually help me anyway since I don't really need a whole port of Node to jscript. I just wanted a really similar module loader and "basic" environment. It's just a view-engine, so it really shouldn't be doing I/O in the same thread anyway.
[03:16] benvie: as an example
[03:17] benvie: you can see an example in all its glory here https://github.com/Benvie/reified/tree/master/examples/ttf
[03:17] wdbl: sweet benvie, thanks a lot
[03:17] benvie: that's just a single unlderlying buffer with the mapping built over top of it

[03:19] AdamGoodrich has joined the channel
[03:19] wdbl: me too :) I like it better because I get to work on what I want
[03:19] benvie: that's the problem
[03:19] benvie: I find it hard to not do that
[03:19] wdbl: me too haha
[03:20] wdbl: I want to fix software development!
[03:20] wdbl: it's broken
[03:20] benvie: it's not that I don't do useful stuff, it's just whatever I want to do
[03:20] wdbl: yeah, I'm the same way
[03:20] iangreenleaf has joined the channel
[03:20] benvie: and yeah I have an overarching similar concept
[03:20] wdbl: I can't resist spending weeks and weeks exploring the most minute problem
[03:21] karterk has joined the channel
[03:21] benvie: like I built this lib in order to making node-ffi easier for bindings to libraries
[03:21] benvie: and that's so I can do stuff like run a chrome browser view on the main node thread
[03:21] benvie: too many things
[03:22] wdbl: oh so you're going forward with the full-on "run the UI in a node process"?
[03:22] benvie: having reified working as well as it does though will help with a bunch of stuff, it drastically simplified anything involving mapping data
[03:22] benvie: yeah
[03:22] wdbl: that's cool, I'm jealous because I suck at C++
[03:23] benvie: it took a roundabout into this project
[03:23] wdbl: I'd love to see someone bind Node.js to Win32 AND Cocoa in a totally framework agnostic fashion
[03:23] benvie: because you really need to have good mapping of the data when you're doing ffi
[03:23] mattgifford has joined the channel
[03:23] wdbl: so if I say var b = new Button(); I get a native button
[03:24] benvie: the stuff I was working on was like broken in subtle ways that I couldn't track down because the data abstractions weren't adequate so it was back to the drawing boardf
[03:24] wdbl: ok well it sounds like you're making progress now
[03:24] benvie: yeah I mean that's sort of the area I'm going
[03:24] wdbl: sweet dude I can't wait to see what you come up with
[03:24] benvie: I've mapped the windows api and I've run windows guis on the main node process
[03:24] wdbl: I'm going a separate route and putting Node.js in it's own process and letting it communicate with the jscript js that runs in my C# app
[03:24] benvie: but now I can actually look more towards a platform once this is integrated with some kind of ffi

[03:25] Es0teric: if you use the mysql module for node...
[03:25] benvie: the cool thing about it though is that it's useful with any kind of buffer based api so it has a lot of applications
[03:25] Es0teric: how do you hide the password and stuff
[03:25] Es0teric: from the client side user?
[03:25] benvie: like I did this font thing in a few hours
[03:26] k1ttty has joined the channel
[03:26] wdbl: I should really learn some C++. I can read it well enough, I just don't know how to use any of the tools

[03:26] Brandon_R: same gere
[03:27] Brandon_R: gyp looks nice but hardly any documentation
[03:27] benvie: ultimately I don't really want to spend much time in C or C++ so I keep working to make it accessible from JS
[03:27] benvie: i can at least do the stuff I need to get that done though
[03:28] codepal has joined the channel
[03:28] wdbl: I really don't want JS to be fragmented even more with Microsoft's lame Metro crapification
[03:29] wdbl: the people want native JS, Microsoft gives it to them with one catch - it will only ever work on Windows
[03:29] benvie: if it's not less limited than I last saw I won't really be interested in it
[03:29] mattgifford has joined the channel
[03:29] Es0teric: who has used the mysql module for node here?
[03:29] benvie: I'm not about to use an interface where I can have one program open at a time
[03:29] Es0teric: infact, how would you use node to communicate with the mysql database?
[03:29] wdbl: yeah, no thanks to that
[03:30] wdbl: Es0teric: sockets
[03:30] Es0teric: wdbl say what?
[03:30] wdbl: Es0teric: look here, there are node mysql drivers: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-db-mysql
[03:31] Es0teric: wdbl i understand that but how would i actually access the tables?
[03:31] Es0teric: i'd basically be giving the client side user my db info
[03:31] Es0teric: in vars
[03:31] Es0teric: :|
[03:31] wdbl: Es0teric: you have to pick one of those packages that I linked to first and follow it's instructions
[03:32] wdbl: Es0teric: no, your Node.js javascript runs on a server and the client-side javascript runs in a browser or somewhere else
[03:32] Es0teric: wdbl ok well i am trying to run ONLY client-side node
[03:32] wdbl: I dont' know what that is
[03:32] Es0teric: because i want to integrate with my php files
[03:32] creationix: browsers can't make tcp connections
[03:33] creationix: only http and websocket
[03:33] creationix: so a browser can't connect direct to a db
[03:33] wdbl: Es0teric: you want your php code to call some Node.js code?
[03:33] wdbl: and have Node.js get stuff from MySQL?

[03:34] thurmda1 has joined the channel
[03:35] deoxxa: Es0teric: node.js (generally) is a server-side thing - it doesn't run on the client
[03:35] Es0teric: deoxxa so then how do i integrate my php with node?
[03:35] deoxxa: well, that depends on what exactly you want to do
[03:35] Es0teric: deoxxa well i eventually want to push events to the client in real time
[03:36] Es0teric: i know i need socket.io and node for that
[03:36] deoxxa: well, you have a few options
[03:36] deoxxa: you don't necessarily need socket.io for it
[03:36] deoxxa: it is a great way to get it done, yes, but it's not the only option
[03:36] deoxxa: if you have a large PHP application already, pusher might do what you want
[03:37] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[03:37] deoxxa: see http://pusher.com/ for more info on that
[03:37] deoxxa: however!
[03:37] Brandon_R: pubhub.com
[03:37] deoxxa: that too, is a great option
[03:38] CrankyMonkey: deoxxa: When you say integrate PHP what do you mean?
[03:38] Es0teric: deoxxa pusher is a paid app
[03:38] Es0teric: i am on a budget here
[03:38] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[03:38] deoxxa: CrankyMonkey: i don't remember saying "integrate php"
[03:39] deoxxa: Es0teric: well, there's two parts to a socket.io application - the server and the client
[03:39] CrankyMonkey: oops
[03:39] CrankyMonkey: Sorry.. Es0teric
[03:39] deoxxa: you'd run the server "somewhere" and have the client connect to it
[03:39] Es0teric: right… deoxxa 
[03:39] deoxxa: then you could expose an internal api for your php application to hit to push events to it
[03:40] Es0teric: expose an internal api?
[03:40] Es0teric: you mean create one?
[03:40] deoxxa: correct
[03:40] jxson has joined the channel
[03:40] Es0teric: i would create the API via REST then have node push the information back
[03:40] Es0teric: right?
[03:41] deoxxa: that'd be a good way to do it, yep
[03:41] Es0teric: that sounds like
[03:41] kevwil has joined the channel
[03:41] Es0teric: ALOT of work
[03:41] deoxxa: pimpin' ain't easy
[03:41] Es0teric: but then how would i recieve the information that was pushed via node?
[03:41] Es0teric: and would this infomation be recieved in real time?
[03:41] deoxxa: depends on what you mean by "real time"
[03:42] mikl has joined the channel
[03:42] deoxxa: you could have your php application tell the node application that "something" has happened
[03:42] deoxxa: then the node application can push it out to all the connected clients
[03:42] deoxxa: you can also do the same in reverse - have the node application talk to the php application when something is sent in from a client
[03:42] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[03:42] deoxxa: this is all assuming you have a large php codebase that you don't want to rewrite in javascript
[03:43] Es0teric: deoxxa having node talk to the php client seems alot simpler than having the php talk to the node client
[03:43] Es0teric: so whatever node pushes out
[03:43] deoxxa: well you'd need to have both things happen
[03:43] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[03:44] Es0teric: deoxxa so then… that would all be via the api i would have to make right/
[03:44] Es0teric: ?
[03:44] deoxxa: presumably, yes
[03:44] Es0teric: now the pusher app
[03:44] Es0teric: it says it supports 20 connections
[03:44] warz has joined the channel
[03:44] warz has joined the channel
[03:45] Es0teric: would that be 20 people connecting to it?
[03:45] deoxxa: 20 simultaneous users, yes
[03:45] Es0teric: or one setup
[03:45] Es0teric: freakin hell...
[03:45] Es0teric: -_-
[03:45] Es0teric: how about APE as an alternative/
[03:45] Es0teric: ?
[03:45] deoxxa: you could build something in node that does something similar in about 10 lines of code
[03:45] deoxxa: just so you know
[03:45] Es0teric: deoxxa wait what?
[03:45] Es0teric: rewind that real quick
[03:46] Es0teric: something similar in node
[03:46] Es0teric: in 10 lines of code?
[03:46] deoxxa: what you want to do, if i understand correctly, is notify the client of something happening as soon as it happens
[03:46] deoxxa: no?
[03:46] Es0teric: yes, deoxxa 
[03:46] arduix has joined the channel
[03:47] dtrejo: dshaw_: majestic dubstep haha
[03:47] deoxxa: well, you build a small application that allows users to connect to the socket.io side and has another interface that your php code talks to to "push" events out
[03:48] dshaw_: dtrejo: groan
[03:48] dtrejo: yeah I like my own dubstep haha
[03:48] dtrejo: the drop took way too long

[03:48] kvda has joined the channel
[03:49] dshaw_: Also, maybe I've just heard that background too much.
[03:49] Es0teric: deoxxa how would that work though? how would i have the php code talk to node?
[03:49] Es0teric: would i have to json_encode the data?
[03:49] dtrejo: dshaw_: have you heard any of masuka's minimixes? all your favorite dubstep artists put together like girltalk: http://soundcloud.com/masuka/sets/micromix-series/
[03:50] deoxxa: Es0teric: there's a couple of approaches - you could shove events into a table in mysql and use it as a message queue, or you could just call out from php over http to node
[03:50] deoxxa: (or any number of other mechanisms)
[03:51] Es0teric: well deoxxa shove events into a table in mysql like...
[03:51] Es0teric: "notify1"
[03:51] Es0teric: ?
[03:51] dshaw_: dtrejo: nice
[03:51] Es0teric: or whatever the user saves into the table

[03:54] deoxxa: so hold on a second, i'll write a gist that shows the basics

[04:09] benvie: I really hate the dnode turtle
[04:09] qsl1pknotp has left the channel
[04:09] deoxxa: so you'd run that somewhere, then push objects like {"type": "user-logged-in", "data": {"username": "herp", "nickname": "derp"}} at it
[04:09] tristanz has joined the channel
[04:10] deoxxa: (you'd want to improve on it a bit though, making sure only your application can push events to it and such)
[04:10] Es0teric: deoxxa well give me a minute i am still reading on line 24 lol
[04:10] Es0teric: referencing between expressjs and that
[04:10] deoxxa: oh, there's a typo too, on line 21
[04:10] deoxxa: should be if (!req.body || !req.body.type) {
[04:11] Es0teric: so, deoxxa why are you using expressjs?
[04:11] Es0teric: why that specfically?
[04:11] deoxxa: it's really just my framework of choice - you could use plain old require("http") but express (and connect, which it's based on) take away a lot of the boilerplate code
[04:12] Es0teric: i see
[04:12] Es0teric: so its less to call but with the same functionality
[04:12] Es0teric: r
[04:12] Es0teric: ight?
[04:12] deoxxa: yep
[04:12] Es0teric: intresting

[04:13] Es0teric: so the bodyParser() gets whatever is in the body into the format expressjs accepts?

[04:14] Es0teric: if it doesnt have the accepted format
[04:14] deoxxa: yep

[04:16] deoxxa: you don't need to get any info from node
[04:16] deoxxa: you're just doing a POST request with the event you want to transmit in the body
[04:17] Es0teric: so node wouldnt really be pushing data into the db.. it would just be retrieving the data, php would be inserting the data
[04:17] Es0teric: right?
[04:17] deoxxa: there's no db involved, there
[04:17] deoxxa: to do it via a db would be quite a bit more complicated
[04:18] alejandromg has joined the channel

[04:19] deoxxa: Es0teric: that doesn't have an easy answer, unfortunately
[04:19] deoxxa: it sounds like you want to do more than just push events to clients
[04:19] Es0teric: well, deoxxa i was logically thinking that if node pushed the data into the db in real time, the data would be retrieved in real time

[04:24] Es0teric: do?
[04:24] deoxxa: req.body is just the body of the request
[04:25] Es0teric: right
[04:25] deoxxa: <deoxxa> so you'd run that somewhere, then push objects like {"type": "user-logged-in", "data": {"username": "herp", "nickname": "derp"}} at it
[04:25] Es0teric: ohhhh ok
[04:26] Es0teric: deoxxa and whats the specific purpose of .emit?

[04:27] merlin83 has joined the channel
[04:29] jxson has joined the channel
[04:29] Es0teric: so then emit is like EventEmitter

[04:35] michaelmartinez: Telenull: what have you used?
[04:35] Telenull: At a previous job I used MySQL exclusively, at my current job I use a lot of CouchDB and a little Redis.
[04:36] Telenull: Neither of them involve much in regards to high scale.
[04:36] Telenull: and I'm one who enjoys SQL, but I can see the benefits of NoSQL.
[04:37] konobi: psql++

[04:39] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[04:39] Telenull: IMO, if you're going to be doing things with data that a) doesn't need a lot of post-processing, b) has roughly equal (within 60/40) reads/writes and c) has complex relationships, then I would say an SQL based system is for you.
[04:39] Telenull: If you're doing tons of writes and not a lot of reads that can't be optimized with map/reduce, then NoSQL is a better option.

[04:54] Telenull: myndzi: nope :P
[04:54] myndzi: so that instead of piping the data back and processing it, i can process it and then send less data
[04:54] myndzi: meh ok

[08:02] savudin: on several sites, even on debuggable.com authors are saying that if my project if "big" I should consider using some other technology like java, ruby etc.
[08:03] savudin: why is that?
[08:03] savudin: I'm planing a community portal for outdoor activity, pretty complex in features and I am considering of using node.js
[08:03] deoxxa: probably because they haven't seen evidence of a successful node.js based application
[08:04] deoxxa: which is fair enough, success stories for large applications in node are pretty sparse at the moment
[08:04] deoxxa: but that doesn't mean it's not suitable - it's just that most complicated applications aren't, you know, done yet
[08:04] savudin: but there are no any huge dissadvanteges in technology?
[08:05] deoxxa: well, javascript lets you get yourself into some pretty big messes
[08:05] deoxxa: the same way as C
[08:05] deoxxa: its flexibility is probably its biggest downfall
[08:05] savudin: and debugging on the other hand :)
[08:06] konobi: deoxxa: voxer, yahoo, linkedin? not big enough?
[08:06] savudin: I am not experienced with javascript at all, but really like what node is offering
[08:06] deoxxa: konobi: they're not exclusively node.js though - detractors will assign their success to their other technologies

[08:11] deoxxa: there's a lot of really exciting stuff happening, which makes it a really interesting system to work with, but it also means there's a lot of changes all the time
[08:11] hh__: yea
[08:12] deoxxa: if you lock yourself to a specific version, you have to give up fixes in some modules
[08:12] hh__: but the app is nothing without the backed service so
[08:12] deoxxa: if you try to keep up with the latest node release, you risk having to move to new modules when old ones are no longer supported

[08:15] nicholas_ has joined the channel
[08:15] wereHamster: sinclair: when did it suffer from that?
[08:15] deoxxa: sinclair: node.js is webscale

[08:16] deoxxa: also it's agile, and uh, other trendy things
[08:16] sinclair: deoxxa: wereHamster: how does it scale out? as application instances or some other way?
[08:16] hh__: ACTION points to instagram again :p they seem to be scaling fine
[08:16] wereHamster: sinclair: you have two choices (as with any other webapp): you either use bigger machines or more machines.

[08:18] sinclair: deoxxa: its is IAAS or PAAS?
[08:18] deoxxa: PAAS, i think
[08:18] deoxxa: but i'm not much of an initialism guy
[08:19] konobi: no.de is PAAS-ish IAAS... you want to scale up... you move to a paid version
[08:19] deoxxa: they offer a whole range of hosted services, and a program for third parties to do the same through their services
[08:19] savudin: sinclair have you checked out nodejitsu?
[08:19] deoxxa: and they're pretty expensive
[08:19] djcoin has joined the channel
[08:19] sinclair: i'll be honest, something with a free quota would be nice
[08:19] deoxxa: let me get this straight
[08:20] deoxxa: you want to "scale"
[08:20] deoxxa: but you don't want to pay for the privilege?
[08:20] sinclair: deoxxa: nope
[08:20] hh__: geocities fanboy
[08:20] deoxxa: then why such a big emphasis on the free quota?
[08:21] savudin: sinclair nodejitsu.com
[08:21] sinclair: deoxxa: i want a free quota so i can play around, and to be able to pay real money for CPU, Bandwidth and Storage should i ever consider it for a commercial application
[08:21] deoxxa: fair enough
[08:21] hh__: which heroku lets you do
[08:21] deoxxa: most companies will give you a free trial though, if you ask
[08:21] sinclair: deoxxa: and it had to be price competitive with say... AppEngine
[08:22] wereHamster: sinclair: what exactly do you mean by 'free quota'?
[08:23] hh__: hard to compare to appengine, they have different pricing structure
[08:23] sinclair: wereHamster: on AppEngine, they offer up a free quota with quite reasonable limits, if your application goes over that, it either shuts down, or automatically scales up (with new instances created by the platform) with billing enabled
[08:23] hh__: but just don't use heroku's database service, and its affordable
[08:24] wereHamster: sinclair: what 'quota'? The used bandwidth? # of http requests? database size?
[08:24] sinclair: wereHamster: im from a AppEngine background, looking for reasons to use nodejs, with plans of looking for something that will handle web sockets over AppEngines channel framework
[08:24] sinclair: wereHamster: i don't have the quota limits with me at the moment, but all of the above
[08:24] dscape: sinclair: to my knowledge only nodejitsu does websockets
[08:24] dscape: so this conversation is done
[08:24] dscape: :)
[08:25] deoxxa: heh
[08:25] dscape: off for coffee now
[08:25] wereHamster: no.de does as well.
[08:25] wereHamster: you get a solaris zone, whatever you do in it is up to you.
[08:25] hh__: if you pay $
[08:25] hh__: free no.de doesn't do websockets
[08:26] konobi: nope... it's available on no.de
[08:26] konobi: you just need to ensure you use the right websocket versions
[08:26] sinclair: it would be nice to know the cost of using sockets from someone who had experience paying for them on whatever platform
[08:26] hh__: hmm
[08:27] dscape: sinclair: in computing people (and provider) always care about the fundamentals
[08:27] dscape: cpu, disk, memory, network
[08:27] sinclair: hh__: also, i never used geocities 
[08:27] hh__: does nodejitsu just use amazon ec2 for servers?
[08:27] dscape: websockets is just part of the network (read bandwidth) part of the pricing
[08:27] sinclair: dscape: what makes you think i don't care about cpu, disk, memory and network?
[08:28] dscape: nothing, you just didnt wait for my next sentence :)
[08:28] sinclair: fair enough
[08:28] sinclair: hmm, it would be nice to have a comparison of web sockets on no.de vs channels on appengine
[08:29] emattias_ has joined the channel
[08:29] sinclair: but in general, no.de and heroku are the most popular node.js cloud platforms out there right?
[08:31] sinclair: dscape: web sockets would likely have some considerable cpu overhead too
[08:31] level09 has joined the channel
[08:32] wereHamster: sinclair: depends on what you do with them. Without any traffic there is hardly any cpu involved
[08:33] sinclair: wereHamster: but with a lot of traffic, and little activity, that still translates into many many open http connections to the server
[08:33] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[08:33] wereHamster: well, of course.
[08:33] sinclair: wereHamster: im a little unfamiliar with how modern platforms handle that, 
[08:33] tvw has joined the channel
[08:33] sinclair: automagically
[08:33] wereHamster: uhm.. let's say: very well?
[08:34] dr0id has joined the channel
[08:34] sinclair: wereHamster: yeah, to what extent, and to what cost
[08:34] konobi: line rate?
[08:35] vguerra has joined the channel
[08:36] cosmincx has joined the channel
[08:37] `3rdEden: konobi nope it's fully available on no.de
[08:37] schredder has joined the channel
[08:37] `3rdEden: because the HTTP proxy is to old
[08:37] sinclair: heroku offers up a free 1 dyno 50req/sec quota, and is elastic scalable
[08:37] sinclair: thats pretty awesome
[08:37] `3rdEden: The last time I checked it only supported draf 75/76 websockets, which are no longer used/usefull

[08:48] benvie: this is javascript that may hit something familiar to you
[08:48] benvie: https://gist.github.com/1973743
[08:49] yaymukund: is there an event that's triggered after my server has started? I'm using express.
[08:49] deoxxa: is that
[08:49] sinclair: benvie: lol, is that the win32 API in Javascript?
[08:49] deoxxa: winapi
[08:49] yaymukund: trying to do basically app.on 'started', begin_tests
[08:49] DuoSRX has joined the channel
[08:49] benvie: yeah
[08:49] deoxxa: wow
[08:49] benvie: all of it
[08:49] benvie: I tend to do be doing things in JS outside of the norm
[08:49] deoxxa: that's simply frightening
[08:49] sinclair: benvie: how does one interop with the win32 dll's
[08:49] sinclair: with JavaScript
[08:50] deoxxa: yaymukund: app.listen(port, host, function() { console.log("Started lol!"); })
[08:50] yaymukund: deoxxa: ahh, app.list takes a function. thanks again
[08:51] benvie: sec
[08:51] benvie: that's actually the purpose of this project I'm working on
[08:52] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/node-ffi
[08:52] sinclair: what are you going to use it for?
[08:52] benvie: so I'm working on redoing the API for it
[08:52] deoxxa: oh neat, ffi
[08:52] sammmy: What's a good module for sending emails?
[08:52] deoxxa: i tried to use that for something once
[08:52] benvie: to make it easier to map data structures

[08:52] sinclair: benvie: windows programming in JavaScript?
[08:52] Vennril has joined the channel

[08:53] schredder has joined the channel
[08:53] benvie: https://gist.github.com/1938424
[08:53] sinclair: benvie: wouldn't it make more sense to try and interop with a managed framework of some kind?
[08:53] benvie: that's code to open a Windows window
[08:53] benvie: and runs the event loop for processing messages using setTimeout
[08:53] benvie: not exactly, ffi is generally the best route for dynamic languages
[08:54] sinclair: benvie: the var wndProc line is hilarious
[08:54] davidbanham has joined the channel
[08:54] benvie: it's what you'll find in use in ruby, python, haskell, etc.
[08:54] bartt has joined the channel
[08:54] benvie: yeah this is what I did before I generated the whole api bindings
[08:54] benvie: but my plan is to go a lot further
[08:54] graeme_f has joined the channel
[08:55] sinclair: benvie: its awesome that you are involved in this, however, why?
[08:55] benvie: to build that managed framework essentiall
[08:55] benvie: automatically handle all the marshalling
[08:55] sinclair: benvie: no one actually codes in win32 anymore

[08:55] benvie: but being able to access it enoiugh to get things done
[08:55] sinclair: benvie: um
[08:56] benvie: my goal right now is to run a chromium instance on the main node process
[08:56] sinclair: benvie: get what done?
[08:56] benvie: to make node into a desktop application platform
[08:56] yumike has joined the channel
[08:56] benvie: well, to make that one of it's many skills
[08:56] yaymukund: deoxxa: is that documented anywhere? digging through express docs with no luck.
[08:57] sinclair: benvie: hmmm, im not sure if it will fly mate, its cool to be able to make a win32 window with JavaScript, but win32 is just not practical anymore
[08:57] hzin_ has joined the channel
[08:57] benvie: well I don't really want to spend much time in it, I want to bring the web gui to the desktop
[08:57] yaymukund: deoxxa: nm, found it
[08:57] yaymukund: :D
[08:57] ccare has joined the channel
[08:57] benvie: I want to use html and css to make desktop apps but that requires a baseline platform to do that on
[08:58] benvie: browsers are awesome they just need to be reoriented with something like say node's apis
[08:58] benvie: I have no desire to make native guis
[08:58] kPb_in has joined the channel
[08:58] benvie: but I need to do the minimal level needed for hosting the web rendnerer and requisite stuff

[08:58] benvie: NO
[08:59] benvie: =(
[08:59] benvie: node
[08:59] benvie: I've been working on facets of this for a year
[08:59] kukkelundin has joined the channel
[09:00] sinclair: benvie: hmm
[09:00] benvie: the binary data handling was slowing me down for a while, so I'm looking forward to seeing how things go with redoing the ffi API for a third time
[09:00] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/chrome-nodium/blob/master/compiled/bindings.js
[09:01] sinclair: benvie: i wish i knew what exactly you had planned
[09:01] benvie: primitive bindings
[09:01] benvie: this is what I just got finished the bulk of https://github.com/Benvie/reified
[09:02] benvie: works for any kind of data structures, the example is TTF file format
[09:02] sinclair: benvie: i have my doubts that the win32 Javascript bindings are worth the effort
[09:02] benvie: but the purpose is for mapping C data structures
[09:02] benvie: I mean that's just one part and not a huge specific difficulty
[09:02] benvie: it's the same issue on any platform
[09:03] benvie: how bout this
[09:03] deoxxa: what would be cool would be node.js's apis on a webkit window
[09:03] jacobolus has joined the channel
[09:03] sinclair: yeah, win32 offers a lot, but none of it particularly useful to what people would use JS for
[09:03] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/node-clipboard
[09:03] benvie: I'm not specifically focusing on windows api
[09:03] benvie: that was one adventure
[09:04] benvie: but nice side benefits like my ultra repl now has the option to remap copy and paste keybindings
[09:05] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/blob/master/settings/controls.js
[09:05] sinclair: hmmm
[09:05] benvie: and I can copy and paste javascript objects between contexts
[09:05] sinclair: i like what you are doing, but im just maybe being a little short sighted to see its use
[09:06] kapil has joined the channel
[09:06] kapil: hello
[09:06] benvie: these are all just trivialities, the prize is in creating a web view gui inside node land
[09:06] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[09:06] benvie: that's the thing I want, and I want to make it simple
[09:06] kapil: can anybody help me to sort iut the hangout issue in node.js
[09:06] sinclair: benvie: what about the browser?
[09:06] madhums has joined the channel
[09:07] benvie: I want the browser with less browser and more node
[09:07] sinclair: benvie: the browser "is" the web view
[09:07] benvie: the web view is part of a browser
[09:07] benvie: the major part
[09:07] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[09:07] benvie: but not the whole thing
[09:07] sinclair: benvie: you want that on a desktop, with access to resources, like the filesystem, and other things?
[09:08] benvie: http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/
[09:08] benvie: http://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module/content-api
[09:08] sinclair: benvie : excluding the desktop thing, the browser does all of that
[09:08] benvie: and a screenshot for good measure
[09:08] benvie: browsers don't do this
[09:08] kapil: possible issues leading to sicket hangout in node.js
[09:09] kapil: socket hangout

[09:09] kapil: hello guys
[09:09] kapil: please help me
[09:09] sinclair: benvie: they do do that
[09:10] sinclair: benvie: maybe not the semi alpha transparent background, but in general they do that
[09:10] benvie: I want to do this
[09:10] benvie: require('chromium').open({ width: 500, height: 500 })
[09:11] benvie: for (var x in myOptions) { chromium.document.createElement('div') etc }
[09:11] sinclair: so, why win32?
[09:11] benvie: because that's what I use mostly
[09:11] benvie: and I want it to be cross platform anyway
[09:11] mattgifford has joined the channel
[09:12] benvie: a large part of the benefit of the web platform is that it can be hosted everywhere
[09:12] sinclair: no, i mean, can't you tweak the chromium project to do whatever, without the need to bind JS to win32?
[09:12] benvie: no that IS the part you have to weak
[09:12] lperrin has joined the channel
[09:12] benvie: that's the thing you're missing
[09:12] benvie: this is the minimum I need to make it even work at all
[09:12] sinclair: but its missing for a reason
[09:12] benvie: http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/ that whole project does what I want
[09:12] benvie: I just need to bind it to node
[09:13] benvie: and guess how you do that
[09:13] josh-k has joined the channel
[09:13] ccare_ has joined the channel
[09:13] benvie: using C/C++ and the Windows API and Cocoa and whatever it is on Linux]
[09:13] benvie: each platform, a specific set of steps
[09:13] arduix has joined the channel
[09:13] benvie: it's just that I'm trying to do it with javascript
[09:13] benvie: a lot of manual doing
[09:13] sinclair: so Javascript for portability?
[09:13] benvie: I like javascript
[09:13] sinclair: heh
[09:14] sinclair: i don't mean to be mean, im just curious why you would do all this
[09:14] benvie: besides the web platform is javascript and there's certain benefits once you get over the hump
[09:14] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[09:14] benvie: like when you initialize V8 in the same process it automatically has affinity to existing running ones
[09:14] benvie: and it's possible to actually combine the event loops of the UI thread and node's main thread
[09:15] benvie: which isn't really that possible if you were doing it from some other language or binding
[09:15] sinclair: JavaScript is just a scripting language for browsers
[09:15] sinclair: (and node)
[09:15] sinclair: ow
[09:15] sinclair: now*
[09:15] JmZ_ has joined the channel
[09:16] timoxley has joined the channel
[09:16] sinclair: benvie: its possible to do that in other languages
[09:16] benvie: javascript is the most popularly used language on the planet and it's use is accelerating which means if your interests tend to align with creating tools that developers use then it's a smart choice
[09:16] benvie: not to even go into the qualities of the language or comparisons with others
[09:17] sinclair: benvie: id argue that Javascript is lacking things that modern languages are starting to adopt
[09:17] pors has joined the channel
[09:18] pors has left the channel
[09:18] framlin: sinclair: what is JS lacking?
[09:18] benvie: ES6, which isn't due to be formalized for another year, has probably one of the most powerful meta programming tools there is
[09:18] sinclair: benvie: doesn't mean JS won't have these features eventually
[09:19] sinclair: benvie: not looked at it
[09:19] sinclair: will look at it now
[09:19] benvie: the language you know as javascript is nearly unchanged from how it was a decade ago
[09:19] kapil: can anyone exlpain possible issues leading to socket hangout in node.js
[09:20] sinclair: benvie: right, but that doesn't necessarily make it the right choice for every domain of programming
[09:20] shinuza has joined the channel
[09:20] noisebeuter has joined the channel
[09:20] benvie: no but it's really good for a lot of stuff
[09:21] sinclair: yeah

[09:21] sinclair: a lot of web stuff
[09:21] benvie: my favorite part
[09:21] arcil has joined the channel
[09:21] sinclair: benvie: i've always viewed JS as simply a ideal scripting language, not "THE" language
[09:21] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[09:22] arcil: hey guys. i have a question concerning child_process.fork. if my child process only has a console.log it does not send an exit event to the master. why is that?
[09:22] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[09:22] arcil: does it even exist?
[09:22] benvie: would would change you mind?
[09:23] ccare_ has joined the channel
[09:23] lperrin: arcil, node doesn't exit until its event queue is empty
[09:23] noisebeuter has joined the channel
[09:23] sinclair_ has joined the channel
[09:23] sinclair_: back
[09:23] sinclair_: benvie: hard to say, i really like JavaScript, but just not for all things
[09:24] arcil: lperrin: if i fork a process which has nothing in its event queue i expect it to quit, right?
[09:24] sinclair_: benvie: for example, i like to bind JavaScript to applications to enable scripting options for those applications
[09:25] sinclair_: benvie: i especially like Javascript for implementing certain business logic, but Python is just a good a language for scripting
[09:25] sinclair_: benvie: easy to bind, easy to use
[09:25] lperrin: arcil, yes
[09:25] framlin: sinclair_: because of its mixture of a functional- with an oo-language js is very very powerfull for enterprise web application stuff
[09:25] sinclair_: framlin: its a tough call, id have a hard time imagining JS in the enterprise
[09:26] sinclair_: framlin: outside of some scripting role

[09:26] Franciman_ has joined the channel
[09:26] Franciman_: hi
[09:26] framlin: sinclair_: I do that since 6 years ...  changed from Java and at the beginning I didnt belive that JS is goog for that, but ist is!
[09:26] kPb_in: hey guys.. 
[09:26] sinclair_: framlin: in what way?
[09:27] framlin: its extreemly flexible
[09:27] dobber has joined the channel
[09:27] sinclair_: framlin: so are other languages
[09:27] kPb_in: m looking at this code here: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/deps/uv/src/unix/darwin.c line numbers 235 to 238 and wondering why aren't macros used instead of hardcoding constant values ?
[09:27] framlin: and you can have "Class"-trees as you have in other OO-Languages
[09:27] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[09:28] sinclair_: framlin: yes, but thats not really special
[09:28] robi42 has joined the channel
[09:28] framlin: its that combination between functional-programming with clousures and callbacks and its OO-features
[09:28] arcil: then i don't get why i do not receive the exit event here is the example code: http://pastie.org/private/ofmbf8sr0qlhaelliralmw
[09:29] Murugaratham has joined the channel
[09:29] sinclair_: framlin: and its dynamic, which i like
[09:29] lperrin: arcil, when you spawn a node process with fork
[09:29] lperrin: it keeps a channel to its parent
[09:29] sinclair_: framlin: but its still hard to justify
[09:29] lperrin: to pass messages with send, on('message')
[09:29] framlin: what other way do you know to build enterprice web applications with FAT-Clients/RIAs?
[09:29] lperrin: that's why the child's event queue is never empty

[09:30] schredder has joined the channel
[09:30] robi42_ has joined the channel
[09:30] arcil: ahh
[09:30] sinclair_: framlin: well, if i was .NET, a web server, a database server, a .NET windows application (if i absolutely had to), and on linux, id roll with Mono
[09:30] arcil: can i close this connection?
[09:30] maritz has joined the channel
[09:31] sinclair_: framlin: that's at a minimum or course
[09:31] framlin: or other ways to build distributed platform independant enterprise applications, that work together with Java, PHP and COBOL
[09:31] noisebeuter has joined the channel
[09:31] sinclair_: framlin: thats the thing, web servers don't restrict you on client tech, its all HTTP at the end of the day
[09:31] framlin: sinclair_: and where was yor "logic" with .NET?
[09:31] framlin: on the client?
[09:32] sinclair_: UI logic on the client
[09:32] framlin: ALL logic
[09:32] framlin: besides shared "HEAVY" business-logic
[09:33] sinclair_: logic to read/write from a web server would be managed by the client too, 
[09:33] sinclair_: typically, heavy business logic should be handled on the web server
[09:33] sinclair_: as thats where business logic 'should' go
[09:34] sinclair_: not on the client application (which can disagree with each other) in a distributed environment, 
[09:34] framlin: yes, but most of the logic is not HAEVY shared BL, but logic with business-concerns that is only needed within one "view"
[09:34] sinclair_: but anyway, i don't see that as a justification for JS on the desktop 
[09:34] robhawkes has joined the channel
[09:35] sinclair_: framlin: you are being a little too vauge
[09:35] framlin: ???
[09:35] trivol has joined the channel
[09:35] sinclair_: what do you mean "view"
[09:35] sinclair_: as in a UI view?
[09:35] framlin: we have tabbed XUL-Applications
[09:35] framlin: a view is most of the time one tab
[09:36] framlin: we have hundreds of applications
[09:36] framlin: some has 15 tabs some 2
[09:36] framlin: only 20 tabs are shared
[09:36] sinclair_: and you script the XUL applications with Javascript?
[09:37] framlin: most of the tabs are responsible for a certain business-case
[09:37] framlin: yep
[09:37] sinclair_: so why not a browser?
[09:38] sinclair_: swap XUL for HTML and just script inside a browser (then theres no issue with deployment)
[09:38] framlin: all logic, that has to do with workflows between the apps/tabs or that control, what users are allowed to do is coded at the client
[09:38] framlin: that are historical reasons ;)
[09:38] framlin: we are just migrating to extjs .... horrible IMHO ;)
[09:39] sinclair_: framlin: so, if the rules behind what a user can and cannot do is within the client, whats to prevent a client doing other things against the server?
[09:39] framlin: what do you mean?
[09:39] sinclair_: framlin: "what users are allowed to do is coded at the client", my question is, why isn't that coded at the server?
[09:40] argami has joined the channel
[09:40] deoxxa: not every application is client/server
[09:40] framlin: it has to do with manpower
[09:40] sandfox has joined the channel
[09:41] framlin: there are mor client-developers and the client-developers are mch or productive in javascript, as the server-developers with cobol and php
[09:41] sinclair_: deoxxa: saying a client sorta implys there is a server (especially in the context of a enterprise)
[09:41] framlin: and there is a architectural philosophie to imlement the stuff as local as possible
[09:42] sinclair_: framlin: that still doesn't sound like a good justification for putting the rules behind what people can and cannot do in the client, it sounds like a security risk, and quite difficult to lock down
[09:42] framlin: why
[09:43] sinclair_: because the server should be the authority for what people can and cannot do

[09:43] framlin: where is the diffrence, if i code som business decissons with php on the server or with JS on the client. I am the same person with the same knowledge about the business
[09:43] sinclair_: framlin: this is in the enterprise right?
[09:43] framlin: there should be ONE peace of code, that is the authority
[09:44] framlin: yep
[09:44] sinclair_: framlin: correct, that code should live on a server
[09:44] framlin: why should it live on a server?
[09:44] framlin: is that a law? ;)
[09:44] mattgifford has joined the channel
[09:45] sinclair_: framlin: is your server a web server?
[09:45] k1ttty has joined the channel
[09:45] framlin: it should live on the server, if its shared with other clients, because of DRY
[09:45] sinclair_: so, if there is only one client, its not really a enterprise
[09:46] framlin: sinclair_: yep there are apaches and currently there are first tests with node for some special cases, where apache is not feasabel
[09:46] sinclair_: what would prevent me from submitting data to the server that i shouldn't be allowed to submit
[09:46] sinclair_: what if i could delete data from your server ?
[09:46] framlin: oh, there are about 400 clients
[09:46] markwubben has joined the channel
[09:46] tomasztomczyk has joined the channel
[09:46] framlin: If you would do that, you would be fired
[09:47] framlin: thats allintranert enterprise
[09:47] sinclair_: framlin: that's not the point, it shouldn't be possible
[09:47] framlin: why?
[09:47] sandfox has joined the channel
[09:48] sinclair_: because i could inadvertently corrupt all your data, 
[09:49] sinclair_: by not authenticating the user, and authorizing "all" requests made to a server, you introduce a huge security hole
[09:49] sinclair_: HUGE!
[09:49] framlin: in that way, we can react to the market changes within two or three weeks and not within moths as the competitors do ... so we are market leaders and it works .... but we know, there are a lot of consulters that talk like you do and we are reading books that write as you talk .. but it works and its competitive
[09:49] sinclair_: but its not safe
[09:51] sinclair_: if you are selling this as a product, your expose your company to legal issues as well, being economical and practical doesn't hold up in court
[09:51] sinclair_: anyway, something to think about
[09:52] framlin: maybe, thats theoreticaly unsave, but it works since 30 years (started witch cobol) that way and it earns mony and it makes it possible to develop a system with a growing team, that started with 5 people and has about 70 people today for a world-wide market-leading business
[09:52] sinclair_: its not theoretically unsafe, it is unsafe
[09:53] framlin: ther was no problem since decades ....
[09:53] dannyamey has joined the channel
[09:53] sinclair_: framlin: secure safe applications, its a team effort between the server side developers and the client side developers
[09:53] framlin: and have in mind, we are talking about INhouse - apps
[09:53] sinclair_: framlin: 30 years is quite the legacy tho
[09:54] framlin: for all stuff thats going outside, there are other security-rules ...
[09:54] sinclair_: framlin: you really should start authenticating and authorizing all requests
[09:54] sinclair_: at least suggest it
[09:54] framlin: sinclair_: as I wrote, I had the same "old-school" believes as you some years ago
[09:55] sinclair_: heh, its not old-school to write secure applications 
[09:55] framlin: at my first days with this customer, I thought Its impossible, that this may work ... but ist is ;)
[09:55] sinclair_: but back to JavaScript
[09:55] hellp has joined the channel
[09:55] framlin: ;)
[09:56] sinclair_: framlin: for the enterprise (which is a different beast from general online media), i think i'll stick with .NET
[09:56] framlin: no problem
[09:56] sinclair_: framlin: .NET with IronJS or Jint bindings for scripting with JavaScript
[09:57] sinclair_: framlin: for example
[09:57] framlin: why do you want to have scripting-capabilities?
[09:57] sinclair_: [Database] -> [ORM] -> [Framework] -> [Business Logic]
[09:57] framlin: why not pure .NET?
[09:58] sinclair_: the only candidate for JS i see is the Business Logic
[09:58] framlin: sinclair_: I know that kind of archtecture
[09:58] framlin: we have the same, but the BL - Layer is spitted between client and server where usefull
[09:59] sinclair_: framlin: .NET is good at a lot of things, but still feels quite rigid for the crazy business rules developers fine themselves writing
[09:59] fermion has joined the channel
[09:59] framlin: yepp, thats the point, why we use JS for a lot of BL
[09:59] sinclair_: framlin: in recent years, i have been turning to Python (specifically IronPython) and very recently, Javascript
[09:59] framlin: ist much more flexible
[10:00] sinclair_: framlin: right, its flexibility where flexibility is needed
[10:00] sinclair_: framlin: that doesn't mean JavaScript for everything
[10:00] jimmysparkle has joined the channel
[10:00] sinclair_: framlin: "right tools for the right job"
[10:01] sinclair_: framlin: in a lot of multitenant applications i have been writing of late, using JavaScript means business logic becomes a resource for that tenant
[10:01] framlin: thats what I said. For the hav BL as e.g. calculating the business or creating invoices, we use CObol and more and mor PHP
[10:01] sinclair_: ACTION doesn't touch PHP
[10:02] sinclair_: though i did spend 5 years developing with PHP back in the early 2000's

[10:03] variableNodejs: i'm a newbee
[10:03] variableNodejs: so please help me
[10:03] sinclair_: no
[10:04] eldios has joined the channel
[10:04] tonymilne has joined the channel
[10:04] framlin: but to decide, if the key account manager should be able to change a dealer for a certain product at a certrain state in the lifecycle of the business, we use JS, because the rules for that tend to change very offen and there is only one tab in one application, where you can do that
[10:05] sinclair_: framlin: is your client a browser?
[10:05] framlin: yep
[10:05] framlin: or a xul-runner
[10:05] framlin: depends
[10:05] sinclair_: so, why don't you restrict access to the UI (html, js, css, XUL) from the server?

[10:06] sinclair_: they only get the asset if they are authorized to receive it
[10:06] sinclair_: also
[10:06] framlin: there would be a lot of traffic and there are not so much Cobol-Developers as would be needed, to code all that often changed rules
[10:06] sandfox has joined the channel
[10:06] sinclair_: rewrite the back end?
[10:07] schredder has joined the channel
[10:07] framlin: there were a lot of tires in the last years with a lot of consultants involved, nut they all could not compete with us JS coders ;)
[10:07] sinclair_: security and integrity of data is important enough to warrant a rewrite, especially when all the COBOL developers have since died of old age
[10:08] DrPheltRight has joined the channel
[10:08] framlin: while they are still thinking about heir models we had the implementation finished ;)
[10:09] bergie_ has joined the channel
[10:09] sinclair_: they should be thinking about security
[10:09] framlin: yes, the backend is going to be rewriten in PHP, but its very old and very huge, so that goes step by step as part of some kind of refactoring scenario
[10:09] sinclair_: why PHP?
[10:10] sinclair_: why not Java, or .NET?
[10:11] framlin: the are thinking about security, too. But if there are no problems without the security and if you make a lot of money over deades without security, and you only have a lot of paper and a calculation about huge costs with security, the first way is the better ;)
[10:11] bradleyg has joined the channel
[10:11] framlin: same reason
[10:12] framlin: all that JAVA and -NET peaople where not agile enough to cpmpete with the PHP-Ones
[10:12] sinclair_: framlin: hahaha
[10:12] sinclair_: framlin: that's not true for .NET
[10:12] framlin: most of the reasons are just pure pragmatic
[10:12] Depe has joined the channel
[10:12] satyr has joined the channel
[10:13] sinclair_: framlin: .NET + visual studio = super productive
[10:13] sinclair_: framlin: from database to application, .NET offers everything out of the box with automation tools for everything, but it does cost in licensing windows servers and sql server databases
[10:14] framlin: I think its not for all of the JAVA and .NET - Developers all over the worls, but for all of them, that came to my customer and tried to convince them, that they should use JAVA or .NET for some reasons
[10:14] pickels has joined the channel
[10:14] sinclair_: framlin: in my experiance, that's why people opt for Java
[10:14] trivol has joined the channel
[10:14] sinclair_: framlin: well, .NET is a sensible choice 
[10:14] sinclair_: framlin: PHP is not
[10:14] framlin: thats the next reasson .... licences .... toooo expansive
[10:15] sinclair_: yeah, MS licensing sucks
[10:15] sinclair_: yeah, still, you trade the cost of licensing for the cost in development
[10:15] sinclair_: In java, you tend to work harder than you do in .NET
[10:16] sinclair_: in PHP, you are in a middle ground, but are liable to end up with a poorly written application
[10:16] recycl3 has joined the channel
[10:17] framlin: as I wrote. The agile style we use as JS/Cobol/PHP-teams is FAR quicker than Java and .NET people was and thats not only cheaper in licences, but cheaper in development, too
[10:17] sinclair_: must have some pretty poor .NET developers
[10:17] disappearedng has joined the channel

[14:03] tmcw has joined the channel
[14:03] bnoordhuis: dscape: if the uncaughtException listener throws, node aborts to avoid an infinite loop
[14:03] dscape: bnoordhuis: that's not true if we nextTick
[14:03] bnoordhuis: dscape: that was about f.js
[14:04] dscape: yeah i noticed, i actually need it to carry on until a syncronous limit is met

[14:11] dscape: bnoordhuis: i would agree on behavior
[14:12] dscape: but honestly expected that if i removed the listener

[14:12] dscape: node would reset the safety mechanism

[14:12] snearch has joined the channel
[14:12] dscape: as I, the developer, am stating I want to redo this thing
[14:12] dscape: like this there's no way to do it, other than using nextTick since node doesnt know better

[14:20] bnoordhuis: dscape: that's not how it works with uncaughtException
[14:20] HacDan has joined the channel
[14:21] bnoordhuis: dscape: that's handled from c++ land; node sets a in_uncaught_exception flag. if it's already set, it aborts

[15:10] Raynos: and im trying to get it to run using nvm
[15:10] maritz: heh :D
[15:11] Raynos: the problem is nvm use 0.4.12
[15:11] Raynos: installs 0.4
[15:11] Raynos: but then npm refuses to work :\
[15:11] Raynos: because npm is all like "no u, use 0.6"
[15:11] maritz: yes
[15:11] yawNO: Raynos: y u port it to 0.6
[15:11] maritz: either install an old npm manually or just use npm with 0.6 and then run the app itself with 0.4

[15:27] isaacs: ACTION missing catb0t and v8bot
[15:27] yawNO: isaacs: he means multi line regex i think
[15:27] isaacs: eliocapella: ohh, like this:
[15:27] eliocapella: yeah
[15:28] isaacs: new RegExp(
[15:28] isaacs:   'f[ob]+' +
[15:28] isaacs:   'blerg$'

[15:28] isaacs: ?

[15:28] eliocapella: nice
[15:28] eliocapella: thanks!
[15:28] isaacs: eliocapella: note that then you have to escape things twice: once for the string, and once for the RegExp
[15:28] yawNO: isaacs: i cant test right now but
[15:28] isaacs: just SOME things
[15:28] yawNO: would it work to have \ at the end and then go \n?
[15:28] isaacs: new RegExp('\\$') for instance, to match a $
[15:28] isaacs: rather than the eol
[15:29] yawNO: without using the new RegExp thing
[15:29] yawNO: just //

[15:29] isaacs: yawNO: RegExp is highly optimized and native code.
[15:29] yawNO: eliocapella: k
[15:30] yawNO: isaacs: using something like new Object instead of {} is like 20x slower
[15:30] yawNO: not sure in v8 though
[15:30] eliocapella: isaacs, just to know, are new RegExp cached?
[15:30] yawNO: i remember just some firefox benchs
[15:30] isaacs: ACTION doesn't believe words like "slower" or "faster" without numbers attached

[15:37] yawNO: im sorry for you the 
[15:37] yawNO: Raynos: i hate tests
[15:37] yawNO: but i force myself to write them anyway
[15:37] Raynos: isaacs: did 0.4 have an npm version?
[15:37] isaacs: Raynos: no
[15:37] yawNO: so please, dont ask me that
[15:37] yawNO: :)
[15:37] isaacs: Raynos: also, stop using v0.4
[15:38] isaacs: yawNO: now try this:   var a = new Array(10); for (var i = 0; i < 10; i ++) a[i] = i;
[15:38] isaacs: yawNO: vs var a = []; ...
[15:38] Raynos: isaacs: I avoid 0.4, but I have no choice, I rather avoid upgrading to 0.6

[17:54] creationix: /etc/init
[17:54] truedat101: What's more important with a distro, packages or security?  Isn't centos more agressive on this front?  And in your experience wavded, what was missing that you had trouble finding on centos?
[17:54] sammmy: so /etc/init/howtonode.conf ?
[17:54] creationix: so  if it's /etc/init/howtonode.conf, then you start it with `sudo start howtonode` and stop it with `sudo stop howtonode`
[17:55] creationix: the "respawn" line means to auto-restart the process if it crashes
[17:55] creationix: "start on runlevel [23]" means to start up server boot
[17:55] creationix: I just copy pasted the PATH variable
[17:55] wavded: i'm not sure.  centos claims to be more stable since its really really tested but the problem i've found is it has older packages.. so then you are dealing with finding rpms and building from source.  which isn't terrible but it not fun to maintain a server like that
[17:56] creationix: I think upstart env is very clean
[17:56] creationix: ubuntu has more users I think

[18:08] creationix: reuse objects and arrays when possible
[18:09] sammmy: creationix: upstart uses the start and stop commands?
[18:09] creationix: sammmy, yep
[18:09] dre: I actually ran a test on localhost with 64kb UDP packets and the throughput was great... but with 1500 byte packets (which is what I'm limited to over the internet), the performance degrades really quickly
[18:09] creationix: dre, yeah, if you packets are small, there isn't much you can do about that
[18:09] creationix: just optimize the other paths
[18:09] pendlepa2ts has joined the channel
[18:09] dre: I believe the only objects that are really created are what I get from on('message')...
[18:10] creationix: dre, also, you can give luvit a try if you don't mind lua
[18:10] sammmy: creationix: so if I am using bouncy (node module), I could copy your upstart script, call it bouncy.conf then use sudo start bouncy and be done with it?
[18:10] creationix: it's engine (luajit) performs differently than v8
[18:10] creationix: sammmy, yep
[18:10] creationix: (not sure what bouncy is though)
[18:10] dre: creationix, the most recent test I ran was literally an on('message', function(msg){sock.send(msg,...)}); and it was still bogging down.. and I have an i7
[18:11] sammmy: creationix: look it up. It's a proxy script.
[18:11] sammmy: creationix: I shouldn't just copy your PATH in the script?
[18:11] creationix: dre, maybe dig lower into the libuv bindings
[18:11] creationix: skip event emitter
[18:11] creationix: but that's undocumented private API
[18:11] creationix: sammmy, you want the path on your system
[18:11] creationix: it won't be all the same
[18:12] creationix: sammmy, just "echo $PATH"
[18:12] dre: creationix: hmm yea, that sounds like what I may need.. thanks... looking at luvit now
[18:12] sammmy: Okay I'll replace it with my PATH.
[18:12] creationix: dre, or if you know C, use libuv directly
[18:12] sammmy: However, what if I change my PATH; do I have to change my upstart script everytime I change my path?
[18:12] kev_nz has joined the channel
[18:12] creationix: then you don't have a GC at all
[18:12] creationix: just have to manage it by hand
[18:13] creationix: sammmy, yep
[18:13] creationix: sammmy, I use nvm
[18:13] creationix: sammmy, every time I want to upgrade the server, I have to change the nvm part of my path
[18:13] sammmy: creationix: nvm? Why is it that I don't have to change the upstart script for apache servers?
[18:13] ramitos has joined the channel
[18:13] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:13] creationix: because dpkg upgrades apache in-place
[18:13] creationix: nvm allows multiple concurrent installs of node
[18:14] creationix: so if you want to use a new node install, you have to point to the new path
[18:14] sammmy: I don't need multiple concurrent installs of node.
[18:14] creationix: then just install node in /usr/local
[18:14] ekryski has joined the channel
[18:14] sammmy: I was just saying for other things where I alter my PATH
[18:14] creationix: using the normal ./configure;make;make install
[18:14] thisandagain has left the channel
[18:14] creationix: sammmy, you only need to alter the path  in the script if you want your server to see the changes
[18:14] CoverSli1e: I'm personally a fan of ./configure --prefix=$HOME
[18:14] creationix: sammmy, it only knows what you tell it
[18:15] dre: creationix, I was using node to get away from C for the sake of simplicity, but once my actual algorithm is implemented, it looks like I'll need to just put this into multithreaded C code.. that's just a very slow way to develop... Hopefully a module that directly uses libuv will suffice for this development phase
[18:15] sammmy: creationix: I see. But couldn't I do something like env PATH=$PATH or something?
[18:15] creationix: dre, libuv isn't multi-threaded
[18:15] creationix: dre, and there is node.native
[18:15] creationix: C++ with callbacks
[18:15] sammmy: Also, why is apache2 stored in init.d?
[18:15] creationix: sammmy, that's the old system
[18:15] dre: yea, I meant rewrite my entire application in C
[18:15] kevwil has joined the channel
[18:16] sammmy: creationix: init.d is the old way of doing things?
[18:16] creationix: dre, the easiest probably is to use node private APIs

[18:21] cerebros: 5 stars cross the board
[18:22] creationix: cerebros, what are you using it for?
[18:22] sammmy: creationix: I mean the other codes for > and >>; the code 2 is for stderr, what other codes for other stds are there?
[18:22] cerebros: creationix: i haven't spent much time with webgl, mostly exploring that
[18:23] creationix: sammmy, 1 for stdout
[18:23] cerebros: creationix: it would make multiplayer validation sooo nice tho
[18:23] sammmy: creationix: Is there only two codes, 1 and 2?

[18:28] creationix: WarheadsSE, any more pain than waf was?
[18:28] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: what are you experiencing?
[18:28] TooTallNate: creationix: i think just a couple missing gyp variables

[18:28] WarheadsSE: Well I stopped having to patch waf after moving v8 to shared.
[18:28] creationix: sammmy, probably crashing on start
[18:28] WarheadsSE: gyp keeps liking to think I am building for ia32..

[19:24] Phoenixz: Question.. I use an object that extends events object, so it can have event listeners.. Now, I have a "destroy" even that emits once an object will be destroyed so that in all list objects where it is registered, it can be deleted. My question now is: As I understand it, I have to remove all event listeners before removing the last reference to that object, or I will get memory leaks.. Now, imagine this object A is registered in 3 diferent list 
[19:24] Phoenixz: objects.. Once it fires a "destroy" event, these 3 different list objects will get the "destroy" event, and remove it from the list.. Problem is, how can I remove "all" event listeners? If I remove all listeners once the first object gets the event, the other objects will no longer receive that event, right? How would I go about this?

[19:53] sammmy: creationix: do you think I need to run `reboot` on my server to have the runlevel event emitted?

[19:54] dtrejo has joined the channel
[19:54] CoverSli1e: not on its own
[19:54] creationix: sammmy, yes, but shouldn't need it for testing
[19:54] creationix: manually running start is the same
[19:55] qbert_: whats the best way for file uploads using express ?
[19:55] CoverSli1e: you'd have to get your os to run it on startup
[19:55] kraft has joined the channel
[19:55] sammmy: creationix: start is the same as rebooting?
[19:55] creationix: right, meaning both start your service
[19:55] creationix: with the config I gave
[19:55] sammmy: do I have to run `start bouncy` everytime I change the conf (I have been, just don't know if it's necessary)
[19:56] markwubben has joined the channel
[19:56] creationix: sammmy, if it's running, you'll have to `sudo stop bouncy;sudo start bouncy` to reload the config
[19:56] creationix: but stop it only if it's running

[20:00] sammmy: wavded: Yeah. But idk why it ever bombed out. It's not sending any logs to the error logs I 2>> to
[20:00] Gateway69: ok this is odd, how can i get my user netcom to be able to work with the node js with out sudo .. i know ubuntu question but if anyone knows off hand
[20:01] creationix: sammmy, right, that means it never started successfully
[20:01] sammmy: creationix: I see. So I wonder why it's not starting successfully?
[20:01] creationix: dunno
[20:01] mehlah has joined the channel
[20:02] creationix: sammmy, try a simpler node process
[20:02] sammmy: I know that when I run start bouncy I get this message "bouncy start/running, process 11571"
[20:02] creationix: ahh, bouncy daemonizes itself?
[20:02] creationix: that changes things
[20:02] creationix: nevermind, that's the upstart output
[20:02] WarheadsSE: creationix: any hits as to my problems ?
[20:02] sammmy: creationix: yeah I don't think it daemonizes itself.
[20:03] sammmy: check this out: https://gist.github.com/2140663
[20:03] wavded: it doesnt
[20:03] devaholic has joined the channel
[20:03] sammmy: I run that with start myupstart and it does the exact same thing
[20:03] sammmy: It has nothing to do with bouncy
[20:03] kitt has joined the channel
[20:03] wavded: what happens when you run bouncy command with your routes.json file (or however you have it configured)
[20:03] sammmy: It doesn't even print "Hello" to bouncy-access.log
[20:03] sammmy: bouncy-access.log doesn't even exist.
[20:03] sammmy: wavded: everything works smoothly
[20:03] creationix: sammmy, that's because "hello" isn't a valid command
[20:03] wavded: sammy are you using full paths in your init config

[20:04] PinguinDude has joined the channel
[20:05] creationix: sammmy, that's because "hello" isn't a command
[20:05] sammmy: creationix: I see. so I'll use `echo "Hello"` and see if that works?
[20:06] wavded: yeah creationix is right, you are trying to run the "hello" command
[20:06] creationix: sammmy, try "exec node -e "setInterval(console.log, 1000)""
[20:06] PinguinDude: Hey all, short and quick question. I've found the libraries Bogart and Express. Both seeming to serve the same purpose. They talk about Routing but all force upon using a templating engine. Bogart using Mustache, Express using Jade. I find there is quite a lack of documentation for starting from the ground up. Where do I start if I want to get a basic HTTP server up and running that is secure and what not?
[20:06] creationix: PinguinDude, how basic?
[20:06] benvie: Array.apply(null, Array(32)).map(Function.call.bind(Number)).map(Math.pow.bind(null, 2))
[20:06] creationix: PinguinDude, and what's "secure"
[20:06] yogig has joined the channel
[20:07] sammmy: creationix: put that in place of the other command in my shell script?
[20:07] PinguinDude: creationix: I want to be able to use Socket.io with it, and be able to serve files on certain "routes" so to speak. It's so basic yet I can't seem to find this.
[20:07] PinguinDude: creationix: Also Bogart basically serves my needs but I can't set the root path of the Mustache engine where it to look for my views.

[20:09] creationix: PinguinDude, or just use Connect
[20:09] brianleroux has joined the channel
[20:09] sammmy: creationix: I removed the cd command above and now this works: https://gist.github.com/2140663
[20:09] PinguinDude: creationix: I read that Connect is really slow due to its implementation, despite that I am no expert at these subjects yet.
[20:09] creationix: PinguinDude, where did you read that?
[20:09] PinguinDude: I come from a 10 year programming background, with javascript included. But Node and like are new to me.
[20:09] PinguinDude: creationix: Good question indeed.
[20:10] creationix: PinguinDude, (btw I wrote the original connect and there was such an article early on that was way misleading)
[20:10] PinguinDude: creationix: I read this on a JSGI blog, so honestly, feel free to fill me in on the truths :)
[20:10] creationix: sammmy, does bouncy support absolute paths for the json?
[20:10] PinguinDude: I'm here to learn after all ;)
[20:10] sammmy: creationix: I believe it does. I might just do that instead of cd
[20:10] cjlicata has joined the channel
[20:11] creationix: PinguinDude, yes, that one.  it's true that jsgi dispatching is like 1000 times faster than connect's dispatcher
[20:11] creationix: PinguinDude, but that means nothing
[20:11] sammmy: creationix: also, afaik exec is used instead of script...end script, and visa versa, so idk why you used exec and script...end script in the first place?
[20:11] creationix: sammmy, not sure, it's a few years old, upstart has evolved
[20:12] creationix: PinguinDude, dispath is 0.001% of the overall cost
[20:12] WeeJeWel has joined the channel
[20:12] sammmy: creationix: you don't use upstart?
[20:12] creationix: sammmy, I do
[20:12] creationix: and it's ubuntu 11.10
[20:12] WeeJeWel: What's the best way to get the result body of a remote webpage (like file_get_contents) in nodejs?
[20:12] PinguinDude: creationix: I see, then the guy was probably just nitpicking on his blog.
[20:13] creationix: PinguinDude, anyway, connect has been rewritten since then anyway
[20:13] creationix: connect 2.0 is a lot like express, but with less opinion
[20:13] sammmy: creationix: I'm on ubuntu 10.10
[20:13] sammmy: I think
[20:13] sammmy: how do I check version again?
[20:13] creationix: sammmy, ahh, you might have an older upstart
[20:13] PinguinDude: creationix: So, I have the feeling you're the right man for answering this. Considering I am experienced at programming and client side JS. What do I need to get up and running if I want to be able to fetch /somePage/someAction/someID/ requests and react to that?
[20:13] toxicFork: WeeJeWel afaik http.request() should do it but not sure
[20:13] PinguinDude: I already messed around with Node and Socket.io and wrote a chat etc, so all that is fine as well.
[20:13] sammmy: creationix: that's probably it.
[20:13] PinguinDude: I'm just having a hard time with google I guess
[20:14] WeeJeWel: ok thx toxicFork
[20:14] toxicFork: i JUST STARTED using njs so i'm very likely to be wrong WeeJeWel
[20:14] Gateway69: any reason when i do console.log('hello world); it spits out hello world and then under it undefined ?
[20:14] creationix: sammmy, cat /etc/issue
[20:14] toxicFork: Gateway69, forgot a ' ?
[20:14] benvie: so I made this work in the browser now and it's really cool https://github.com/Benvie/reified
[20:14] Gateway69: > console.log('hellow world');
[20:14] Gateway69: hellow world
[20:14] Gateway69: undefined
[20:15] creationix: PinguinDude, express or connect routes would be easiest
[20:15] creationix: (it's the same really, express uses connect internally)
[20:15] toxicFork: > 3 + 5;

[20:15] Gateway69: ok
[20:16] pors has joined the channel
[20:16] creationix: sammmy, your last gist without the cd worked
[20:16] creationix: don't use cd
[20:16] PinguinDude: creationix: Yeah so from what I gather, connect is a basic framework which makes working with HTTP requests a breeze. Express goes even further than this and from what I gathered tries to be a real website framework.
[20:16] creationix: connect is a plugin system for http middleware layers
[20:16] creationix: express is a framework with opionions using connect
[20:16] sammmy: creationix: true. But then when I use bouncy with the > and 2>> it doesn't work. Maybe I should try removing thouse
[20:16] creationix: like rack and sinatra in ruby
[20:17] creationix: I don't know what bouncy does or expects, might be something there
[20:18] creationix: PinguinDude, also there is an express mailing list and I think irc channel
[20:18] creationix: I don't use express or connect these days
[20:18] PinguinDude: creationix: What do you use these days? Or are you out of the whole JS business?
[20:18] creationix: I help people get started with node while experimenting with new projects
[20:18] sammmy: creationix: GOT IT!!! FINALLY!! XDDD
[20:18] creationix: my latest are libuv ports to other scripting langauges
[20:18] PinguinDude: creationix: I like your style :-)

[20:19] sammmy: creationix: I don't thinnk the > was doing anything in this version because it never printed error logs
[20:20] PinguinDude: creationix: are you on here a lot? And may I ask what timezone you're in? I've had bad experiences with Javascript and IRC channels. Most were empty and not very useful :P
[20:20] creationix: yawNO, it's growing slowly, I wish I had more time for it
[20:20] sammmy: creationix: I'm just glad it's working now.
[20:20] yawNO: im not sure if i like lua or not actually
[20:20] sammmy: creationix: however, is there a way to migrate my server to a newer OS so that what I don't run into these problems?
[20:20] creationix: PinguinDude, I'm on a lot, but most days I'm not able to help out in this channel
[20:20] yawNO: it has some intriguing features but some parts i love bout js are missing
[20:20] creationix: sammmy, that's old enough, it might be easiest to reinstall
[20:20] PinguinDude: yawNO: Lua has a nice syntax compared to most languages in my opinion.
[20:21] creationix: sammmy, but you can try the ubuntu upgrade path
[20:21] myndzi: is there a function handy to convert an integer to an dotted-quad string and the reverse?
[20:21] PinguinDude: creationix: that's cool, I like to get accustomed to people when joining a channel :)
[20:21] creationix: google for instructions, it's different with each version
[20:21] gkatsev: PinguinDude: this channel is cool. very helpful.
[20:21] PinguinDude: So far it doesn't feel like #C++ haha ;-)
[20:21] gkatsev: though, yes, slow, sometimes
[20:21] sammmy: creationix: I'll have to look into it later. I need to do some Node.js now. >_<
[20:22] gkatsev: PinguinDude: is that better or worse than ##c?
[20:22] akiva_ has joined the channel
[20:22] PinguinDude: I've never spent time in there, but in #C++ things are tight.
[20:22] creationix: node.js = ES5 (V8), luvmonkey = JS1.8.5 (SpiderMonkey) luvit= lua5.1 (luajit), candor.io = candor (candor)
[20:22] PinguinDude: creationix: I believe I ran into luvit on google before :)
[20:22] gkatsev: PinguinDude: heh, haven't heard muh about #C++ but ##c is hardcore
[20:23] yawNO: PinguinDude: if i dont like lua i dont see the point in switching from node to luvit

[20:23] argami has joined the channel
[20:23] creationix: yawNO, the languages are close enough, don't base a decision on that
[20:24] chrisinajar: so hypothetically, how does one get packages into npm? is there a list of requirements somewhere?
[20:24] creationix: node is much more mature and has a huge community, luvit is lean and fast
[20:24] RLa: lua seems to have even weirder ways to define classes than javascript
[20:24] PinguinDude: yawNO: from my experiences with JS and Lua, which are pretty limited compared to my other language experiences. JS and Lua are really similar.
[20:24] creationix: chrisinajar, just `npm publish`

[20:26] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: (gamedev remark) you may be interested in my opengl node engine. it uses jQuery as the graphics API. it's not done but it works right now..
[20:26] creationix: node is probably better for webservers
[20:26] PinguinDude: Now you two owe me some explaining here
[20:26] PinguinDude: haha
[20:27] creationix: jquery + opengl
[20:27] creationix: now that's interesting
[20:27] PinguinDude: chrisinajar: I am an OpenGL lover ;-)
[20:27] rlidwka: are you talking about webgl?
[20:27] creationix: webgl in node is easy enough
[20:27] creationix: just bind opengl es 2.0 to js
[20:27] chrisinajar: no, it's a direct binding to openGL, which i then use purely in JS to implement a fake DOM which i then wrap jQuery with
[20:27] Prudhvi has joined the channel
[20:27] sammmy: creationix: it seems like my version doesn't support local paths, because the error logs were being placed at / the whole time..
[20:27] creationix: how does a dom map to opengl?
[20:27] yaymukund: :q

[20:28] chrisinajar: i'm really really really bad at windows
[20:28] sammmy: creationix: why would it be chdir?
[20:28] creationix: that's what the upstart docs say
[20:28] creationix: I don't know where I got cd from
[20:28] creationix: chdir outside the script block
[20:29] PinguinDude: chrisinajar: so basically you got a js engine, similar to node for example, except it allows you to use OpenGL in a jquery fashion?
[20:29] rlidwka: omg... 
[20:29] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: it's entirely in node
[20:29] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: and not just in a jQuery fassion, i actually ported jQuery's source code to work
[20:29] PinguinDude: :D

[20:30] PinguinDude: overdosing on cocaine eh?
[20:30] PinguinDude: haha
[20:30] chrisinajar: i was explaining to a non-technical person why this engine is neat and that's what i came up with
[20:30] chrisinajar: so i copy and pasted it into my readme
[20:30] PinguinDude: oh don't get me wrong :)

[20:31] creationix: chrisinajar, so what are the dom elements? 
[20:31] creationix: I've only does GLES2
[20:31] creationix: *done
[20:31] chrisinajar: in my DOM, it's instances of my Element class
[20:31] creationix: and GLES2 is all raw vertexes and shaders
[20:31] sammmy: creationix: and chdir doesn't appear to work either
[20:31] chrisinajar: i haven't done anything fancy like that yet
[20:31] rlidwka: chrisinajar: doesn't mean that with your app it's possible to make online browser game and a native game using one source code?)
[20:31] chrisinajar: i'm bad with ogl so it's an uphill fight
[20:31] creationix: sammmy, try `man upstart` see if that helps any
[20:32] chrisinajar: but i have animated textured squares right now
[20:32] PinguinDude: I was an expert on OpenGL before v3 and up came around :p
[20:32] chrisinajar: rlidwka: theoretically, eventually, yes.
[20:32] PinguinDude: Still learning to get used to that
[20:32] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: i know how to draw squares :P
[20:32] PinguinDude: <3
[20:32] PinguinDude: haha
[20:32] chrisinajar: it took me a day to figure out how to make it run in 2d made :P

[20:33] yawNO: mass quit @ bostom api jam
[20:33] benvie: dom is a useful abstraction for allowing that type of agnostic interoperability, and more things should have dom apis built on top of them
[20:33] PinguinDude: I use GLFW these days, prefer it to SDL.
[20:33] PinguinDude: Since SDL can't do OGL 3.2 and up unless I use SDL 1.3 which is unstable.
[20:33] justicefries: or SFML.
[20:33] benvie: hmmm
[20:33] creationix: meh, the future is GLES2
[20:33] benvie: gives me an idea
[20:34] creationix: that's what all mobile has
[20:34] chrisinajar: i use node-sql and node-ogl, neither of which seemed to work without my changes, at least not on my (or my friend's) system....
[20:34] PinguinDude: SFMl is what I prefer but last time I checked it wasn't capable of serving me with OpenGL 3.2
[20:34] chrisinajar: i need to research wtf gles2 is
[20:34] benvie: ffi dom
[20:34] justicefries: creationix: eh, stuff like Unity is successfully bridging the gap.

[20:35] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: if you want to help out, i could really use some ogl help :)
[20:35] justicefries: creationix: as far as intelligently building out for both GLES2 and OpenGL
[20:35] creationix: PinguinDude, I'm pretty sure all opengl bindings are meant to be used locally.  It's hard to make GPU calls across a network :P
[20:35] PinguinDude: chrisinajar: feel free to bother me for OpenGL questions. I'm on #freenode daily so.
[20:36] PinguinDude: creationix: I figured, but you never know with the Node crowd.
[20:36] PinguinDude: Crazy bunch of people :D
[20:36] creationix: if you want it in a browser, use webgh there

[20:36] PinguinDude: Yeah I figured, which is what caused my confusion.
[20:37] benvie: isn't there some working thing emscripten style for mapping opengl to webgl
[20:37] PinguinDude: I like chrisinajar's project though. I had thought about implementing this before except I never got around to figuring out how to implement the DOM.
[20:37] wavded has left the channel
[20:37] benvie: dom.js is a full fledged js implemented dom which can help understand the concepts behind hosting a dom
[20:37] PinguinDude: benvie: I don't believe there is a need for that. WebGL is pretty similar to 3.2 and up. Except I believe WebGL still has the old fashion of building VBO's.

[20:38] benvie: I'm just saying I think it exists
[20:38] benvie: not that I did it
[20:38] chrisinajar: PinguinDude: cool, will do :)
[20:38] benvie: I recall reading about it on the emscripten mailing list a while back
[20:38] WarheadsSE: TooTallNate: yup
[20:39] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: so the error you're seeing is armv7 not being defined?
[20:39] WarheadsSE: I'm trying to build the master atm
[20:39] TooTallNate: ok that's good
[20:39] WarheadsSE: once I override the ia32 "default" in configure.gypi
[20:39] WarheadsSE: Yes, but master isn't a release :p
[20:39] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: are you cross-compiling?
[20:39] benvie: the context would be compilinging existing software that was built in c/c++ using opengl
[20:39] WarheadsSE: native on an armv5te
[20:39] TooTallNate: ok
[20:39] WarheadsSE: we do cross compile, after we get it working native.
[20:39] TooTallNate: so then in config.gypi
[20:40] benvie: since emscripen compiled c/c++ to js it's a natural reach also compile opengl to webgl too
[20:40] TooTallNate: add "armv7": "0" to the "variables" section
[20:40] benvie: or whatever that process would entail
[20:40] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: ^
[20:40] WarheadsSE: i saw ;
[20:40] justicefries: benvie: that seems like it'd be a slighlty larger leap, unless it's OpenGL ES 2.0
[20:40] justicefries: if it's OpenGL 3.2...
[20:40] WarheadsSE: remember though im trying to prevent having to hack in
[20:40] justicefries: there's some stuff incompatible
[20:41] benvie: like you get the context right?
[20:41] benvie: emscripten compiles full c/c++ applications and libraries to js
[20:41] benvie: some would say that's not a compatible thing to do
[20:41] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: well the bottom line is that it needs some patches to make arm building smooth
[20:41] TooTallNate: specifically, like setting this variable in the ./configure script
[20:41] TooTallNate: when the arch is "arm"
[20:42] justicefries: no I get the context, yes.
[20:42] justicefries: you'd have to strip out OpenGL 3.2 specific shader stuff, though.
[20:42] justicefries: it wouldn't be 1:1. :)
[20:42] benvie: yeah I imagine it'd involve that kind of thing but I get the impression it's about just making the stuff run
[20:43] justicefries: true
[20:43] benvie: since it's primarily used for porting things that were already built or whatever
[20:43] justicefries: yeah

[20:46] justicefries: I have a Panda board coming tomorrow.
[20:46] justicefries: I'm going to attempt getting it to compile.
[20:46] justicefries: which should be ARMv7
[20:46] creationix: so raspbrry pi is arm11?
[20:46] creationix: is that armv7? I don't remember
[20:46] michaelmartinez_ has joined the channel
[20:47] justicefries: it's armv6
[20:47] WarheadsSE: v8 I have fixed, :p

[20:47] WarheadsSE: RPi is ARM11 single core, with a partial fpu
[20:47] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: so it's compiling then?
[20:47] WarheadsSE: v8 ?

[20:48] WarheadsSE: creationix: read my text : its working now
[20:48] TooTallNate: v8 doesn't *require* armv7

[20:48] WarheadsSE: armv5te
[20:48] Es0teric: when using eventEmitter, EventEmitter.on('name', function(){}); <--- does that trigger when a submit request comes up as name?

[20:49] WarheadsSE: it;d be nice if freenode wever got around to giving alarm our cloaks..
[20:49] Es0teric: RLs, emitted where?
[20:49] justicefries: Node: Runs Everywhere. 1/100 the size of the Java VM.
[20:49] creationix: WarheadsSE, I should take my pile of webos phones and put something interesting on them
[20:49] Es0teric: RLa, emitted where?
[20:49] RLa: Es0teric, depends what uses that EE
[20:49] Es0teric: what do you mean?
[20:49] justicefries: creationix: were you at red dirt ruby conf with wynn last year?
[20:50] creationix: justicefries, yep, I gave the node talk and why it's better than ruby
[20:50] RLa: Es0teric, var ee = new EventEmitter(); ee.emit('name');
[20:50] justicefries: yeah, I remember. I talked about SOA and used node in my talk.
[20:50] creationix: and Dr nik made fun of me

[20:50] ant0no has joined the channel

[20:50] Es0teric: how does it work?
[20:50] Es0teric: or would name be something like whats passed on the body text?
[20:51] RLa: Es0teric, that's very specific for the framework/library you use
[20:51] justicefries: or rather, queueing systems
[20:51] RLa: Es0teric, what lib are you using
[20:51] Es0teric: just node
[20:51] Poetro has joined the channel
[20:51] RLa: Es0teric, so that is http?

[20:52] toxicFork has left the channel
[20:52] WarheadsSE: creationix: what are the SoC in those?
[20:52] Es0teric: RLa so then EventEmitter.on() what would lib would that be in?
[20:52] RLa: Es0teric, it has nicely documented which events both server and request can emit
[20:52] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: master is surpisingly stable right now, for being the unstable branch

[20:53] Es0teric: RLa, i see… i am trying to get the hang of this nodejs stuff though
[20:53] WarheadsSE: its less node js, as event programming ;)
[20:53] Es0teric: because an event would be a click or a focus right?
[20:54] WarheadsSE: not being familiar with that messes with most people
[20:54] creationix: WarheadsSE, mixed, the Pixi is some old Qualcom, the Pre it TI, the newer ones are modern qualcom

[20:55] schredder has joined the channel

[20:55] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: haha, ya that'll add a little to the compile time :p
[20:55] eldios: Es0teric, it would be WAY simpler if you start reading how to implement an EventEmitter

[20:57] WarheadsSE: all I can say then is try it, since npm just runs on top of node.
[20:57] isaacs: iain_: you should be able to just nstall node from source, and get npm by default.

[22:26] niallo: if you already have a node_modules dir populated with deps, and you update the npm-shrinkwrap.json file with a later version, then you run npm install -d, is it expect that npm install -d will *not* update to the version in the newer shrinkwrap ?
[22:26] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[22:26] isaacs: niallo: i'm not sure.  also -d means "debug"
[22:26] isaacs: niallo: -dd is more debugging, and -ddd is a silly amount of debugging.
[22:26] isaacs: it just makes the output noisier
[22:27] iain_: isaacs: proxy, perhaps, but nat is the most likely
[22:27] niallo: isaacs: ok. my main question is really around whether npm install is expected to update to whatever is latest in shrinkwrap file.
[22:27] isaacs: niallo: it should make your current setup match the shrinkwrap
[22:28] isaacs: niallo: but if something is already there, it *might* skip over it, i'm not sure.  what version are you using?
[22:28] niallo: isaacs: ok, in that case there may be a bug somewhere. i am using 0.6.12 and 0.6.13 along with whatever npm is bundled.
[22:28] isaacs: niallo: please post reproducible test.
[22:29] isaacs: niallo: worst case, you can always npm rm whatever, then run `npm install` and it'll put whatvers's in the shrinkwrap in place;

[22:29] Wa has joined the channel
[22:29] niallo: isaacs: already working on the test case, should have one later on today. i would love for npm install to automatically update to latest shrinkwrap as it makes my deployments faster.

[23:06] WarheadsSE: TooTallNate: lol @ v8 .. 3.9.17 kicks the same gyp problem about armv7==1 ...
[23:06] creationix: lcampbell, if you wrap the event sources you can profile some with Date.new() before and after the root function call
[23:06] westg: but async really helps make callbacks look clean
[23:06] Es0teric: how do i get node to communivate with php?

[23:06] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: what do you mean?
[23:07] creationix: lcampbell, it's very tricky and there is no out-of-the-box module to do that
[23:07] lcampbell: creationix: Heh, that's why I was looking for an out-of-the-box solution.
[23:07] WarheadsSE: same failure in pulling in the deps name 'armv7' is not defined while evaluating condition 'armv7==1' in tools/gyp/v8.gyp
[23:07] lcampbell: There's lots of caveats that I probably won't consider until it's expensive to fix.
[23:07] westg: lcampbell: can't you write a module for that

[23:10] Es0teric: AviMarcus my question is would the data be pushed from php to node in real time?
[23:10] AviMarcus: Es0teric, what kind of data? what are you doing? You can use zeromq to push out events in php, and have node listen to them and use whatever handlers you want
[23:11] Es0teric: AviMarcus oh really?
[23:11] AviMarcus: yep: http://www.zeromq.org/
[23:11] argami has joined the channel
[23:11] Es0teric: AviMarcus all these events zeromq pushes when node recieves it
[23:11] Es0teric: it will be in real time
[23:11] Es0teric: right?
[23:11] WarheadsSE: TooTallNate: ah! export GYPFLAGS="-Darmv7=0"
[23:12] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: like i've said a few times, node's ./configure script needs some patches to define that variable when necessary
[23:12] WarheadsSE: yes, you have to manuall set this variable.. apparently
[23:12] Es0teric: so zeromq pretty much gives php socket layers
[23:12] WarheadsSE: lol, this is v8!
[23:12] Es0teric: like
[23:12] Es0teric: socket.io to nodejs
[23:12] Es0teric: right?
[23:12] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: are you compiling v8 straight up? as a shared lib?
[23:13] jj0hns0n has joined the channel
[23:13] AviMarcus: socket.io is made to be used over WAN from a browser
[23:13] AviMarcus: this is a far simpler issue
[23:14] AviMarcus: but yeah, it's realtime as long as something is pushing and node is listening
[23:14] WarheadsSE: TooTallNate: in this case, for testing, yes
[23:14] WarheadsSE: it works best for us with v8 seperate lib
[23:14] Es0teric: AviMarcus because i just want to have node talk to any php script to recieve events in real time or send events
[23:14] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[23:14] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:15] Es0teric: an 'event' in this case would be data into a database
[23:15] Es0teric: or something
[23:15] satyr has joined the channel
[23:15] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: ok, well i guess v8 expects you to invoke gyp with "-Darmv7=0"
[23:15] argami_ has joined the channel

[23:16] TheFuzzb_: Does anyone here use the sqlite3 module?
[23:16] hex`: on http://mongod, all options give me "REST is not enabled.  use --rest to turn on." Where do I use this --rest option? I tried "mongod --rest" on the command line, but I think that's not the correct place to go
[23:16] AviMarcus: westg, legacy code that's already written?
[23:16] TooTallNate: TheFuzzb_: i've used it enough to make it work on windows... which wasn't much :D
[23:17] bindr has joined the channel
[23:17] Es0teric: westg i was thinking of having node on the client side
[23:17] AviMarcus: Es0teric, if you want to LISTEN with php you need to do a funny loop and stuff. It's not nearly as clean as the async listening in node.
[23:17] TheFuzzb_: I am doing a query - SELECT artist.name, album.name FROM album INNER JOIN artist ON artist.id = album.artist_id;
[23:18] bindr_ has joined the channel
[23:18] TheFuzzb_: This works in sqlite3 directly, but because sqlite3 spits this back as an object, and an object cannot have two members with the same name, the album.name always overrides artist.name
[23:19] Es0teric: AviMarcus i see..
[23:19] TheFuzzb_: Is there a way to map the results to the full name, or another name?
[23:19] AviMarcus: TheFuzzb_, a standard sql thing?
[23:19] AviMarcus: " as album_name"
[23:20] Es0teric: AviMarcus so basically with node, i'd be writing html files with javascript in them
[23:20] Es0teric: right?
[23:20] Es0teric: or JSON
[23:20] TheFuzzb_: AviMarcus I've not used that before. *googles*
[23:20] AviMarcus: you basically always need to do that when you do functions in your query.. e.g. max(amount) or whatever because otherwise you get very funny names..

[23:21] Es0teric: i see
[23:21] AviMarcus: erm I was answering TheFuzzb_ 
[23:21] Es0teric: oh
[23:21] AviMarcus: not sure what your question is, Es0teric 
[23:22] TheFuzzb_: AviMarcus Thanks a lot, looks like I've got a lot more SQL to learn :)
[23:22] Es0teric: AviMarcus because i am debating wether i should use ONLY node… or have node talk to php because i am more familiar with php
[23:22] AviMarcus: TheFuzzb_, me too :P
[23:22] AviMarcus: why would you use node and php?
[23:22] Es0teric: AviMarcus because i am more familiar with php
[23:22] AviMarcus: you mean use node in the broswer?
[23:23] steveoh has joined the channel
[23:23] Es0teric: yeah
[23:23] steveoh has left the channel
[23:23] AviMarcus: that's javascript, not node :x
[23:23] nikdo has joined the channel
[23:23] Es0teric: node/socket.io in the browser then php on the server end
[23:23] AviMarcus: node is an implementation of javascript for the server
[23:23] aaronmcadam: Es0teric: there are other projects that might be better suited
[23:23] Es0teric: aaronmcadam like what?
[23:24] AviMarcus: node isn't for use in the browser
[23:24] aaronmcadam: there are socket.io impls for Python, there's probably a Tornado for PHP
[23:24] aaronmcadam: Tornadio
[23:24] aaronmcadam: depending on what u want to do, Pusher might be better suited?
[23:24] Es0teric: yeah but pusher is a paid service
[23:24] aaronmcadam: trying to shape node into something if you "prefer" php
[23:24] aaronmcadam: sounds like a false economy
[23:25] AviMarcus: that said, one common language for your server and client side might be very appealing... but it's very different than php.
[23:25] AviMarcus: ACTION is coming from php to node. a very different way of coding.. but oh how some things seem so much easier and faster to be able to do
[23:25] AviMarcus: basically anything syncronous to node.
[23:25] aaronmcadam: AviMarcus: that's a definite false economy too
[23:26] Es0teric: what about APE
[23:26] Es0teric: ?
[23:27] aaronmcadam: There's also nothing wrong with having your node stuff separate and just have it act like a normal view

[23:27] Es0teric: aaronmcadam well thats what i was thinking of
[23:27] aaronmcadam: man the PHP curl API is so horrible
[23:27] Es0teric: having node on the front, then having PHP cURL to talk to node
[23:27] aaronmcadam: it's not node on the front
[23:28] aaronmcadam: it's socket.io's js wrapper for web sockets
[23:28] aaronmcadam: Es0teric: that google groups post is exactly that
[23:28] Es0teric: i see
[23:29] aaronmcadam: Socket.io just handles IE fallbacks and everything in a nice unified API
[23:29] crutex: ��
[23:29] aaronmcadam: on the frontend I mean
[23:30] Es0teric: so it would make much more sense
[23:30] Es0teric: to just have node
[23:30] Es0teric: and socket.io
[23:30] aaronmcadam: if that's all you want to do?
[23:30] Es0teric: well you see
[23:30] Es0teric: the thing is
[23:30] Es0teric: i have a template
[23:30] Es0teric: for the site
[23:30] Es0teric: its already coded in php

[23:36] bindr has joined the channel
[23:37] aaronmcadam: Es0teric: yeah, push json around, that'd work
[23:37] aaronmcadam: if you must use php for your db retrieval
[23:38] Es0teric: aaronmcadam theres a node module that can retrieve stuff from the db right?
[23:38] aaronmcadam: ...
[23:38] aaronmcadam: Es0teric: there's db drivers for a few, of course man
[23:38] aaronmcadam: node-mysql
[23:38] Es0teric: i see
[23:39] Es0teric: but why cant i just json_encode the data out to a page then have node recieve it?
[23:39] aaronmcadam: is *that* all ur doing?
[23:39] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[23:39] aaronmcadam: there's nothing stopping u, but it seems like a waste
[23:39] Es0teric: aaronmcadam well i am just trying to get this from all angles
[23:39] Es0teric: because i want the real time data capability
[23:40] aaronmcadam: all ur doing is a db query -> real time stream?
[23:40] Es0teric: aaronmcadam well pretty much
[23:40] sugyan has joined the channel
[23:41] aaronmcadam: i guess it would work if u wanted to let php handle the db and node handle the stream
[23:41] Es0teric: thats what i am saying...
[23:41] aaronmcadam: yeh
[23:41] Es0teric: aaronmcadam thats what i am trying to figure out right now
[23:41] aaronmcadam: try it
[23:41] Es0teric: would i have to run node side-by-side with php?
[23:41] Es0teric: like have php listen to port 3000
[23:42] Es0teric: then have node handle the data being pushed to port 3000?
[23:42] aaronmcadam: there is a really dirty hacky way of running node from php
[23:42] aaronmcadam: but I'd stay away from that
[23:42] Es0teric: aaronmcadam yeah
[23:42] aaronmcadam: hmm
[23:42] WarheadsSE: sounds like just implement an API in php via REST, and have node call it
[23:43] aaronmcadam: bingo
[23:43] Es0teric: WarheadsSE say what?
[23:43] WarheadsSE: simplest method, just pass JSON around
[23:43] aaronmcadam: omg rly? haha
[23:43] aaronmcadam: that'd be easy
[23:43] WarheadsSE: it'd be cake
[23:43] andrewde` has joined the channel
[23:44] aaronmcadam: then a bit of sexy front end templating, and your done

[23:58] LukeNukem: mysql*
[23:59] WarheadsSE: aka, can two processes access my MySQL ?
[23:59] Poetro: LukeNukem: yes, u can do that, but that'll require the webserver to proxy some requests to Node, or use node on a different subdomain / port
