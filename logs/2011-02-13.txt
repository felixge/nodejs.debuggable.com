[00:00] sholmes: Hey, so I need help finding a good VPS that's cheap but good.
[00:00] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[00:00] SubStack: cidd: why jsonp when you can socket.io?
[00:00] sholmes: I'll upgrade later, I just need something to get me started.
[00:00] geoffeg: sholmes: i love linode
[00:00] sholmes: I need one that's easy and quick to setup
[00:00] sholmes: geoffeg, cheaper ;P
[00:00] geoffeg: damn, linode is pretty cheap :)
[00:00] sholmes: under $10
[00:00] sholmes: linode is $20
[00:00] Bloudermilk: sholmes: Rackspace Cloud or Slicehost are my personal favs
[00:00] cidd: SubStack: I'm registering a browser session to make sure socket.io is secure
[00:01] sholmes: fanaticalVPS is 10 bucks
[00:01] geoffeg: find a friend with a machine on their home DSL/internet line
[00:01] spaceinvader: SubStack: the pictures are really fun
[00:01] SubStack: tehe
[00:01] mscdex: geoffeg: you're using the result of require() wrong i think
[00:01] SubStack: cidd: I think guillermo got ssl working with socket.io recently
[00:01] mscdex: geoffeg: require() returns an object
[00:01] sholmes: geoffeg: haha, well it can't be something flimsy like that. I need it to at least handle some traffic.
[00:02] geoffeg: alright, i shall play
[00:02] sholmes: Anyone here use fanaticalVPS or 2host?
[00:02] cidd: SubStack: he did...nice
[00:03] mscdex: geoffeg: also you're better off only calling readdirSync once
[00:04] geoffeg: mscdex: yea, i coded that part up piecemeal :)
[00:04] eventi: sholmes: i need at least $20
[00:04] sholmes: I need to be able to host a LAMP stack for now, then I'll get node on there.
[00:04] sholmes: eventi: why do you need at least that?

[00:05] eventi: and bandwidth, and headaches
[00:06] jchris has joined the channel
[00:06] eventi: that said, an ec2 micro instance is dirt cheap, but it'll crash when you compile node
[00:06] tanepiper: eventi: i got node to compile fine, but it was SLOOOOOOOW
[00:06] eventi: lol
[00:07] tanepiper: that was on the free instance
[00:07] eventi: I kept starting on a micro, then going to get coffee, and it'd reboot
[00:07] aurynn: Reasons I pay for a Linode slice :)
[00:08] eventi: beg for another $10 and get RSC or slicehost or something
[00:08] marcello3d: <- uses slicehost
[00:08] eventi: ACTION does too
[00:09] eventi: love the chat support
[00:09] aurynn: I seem to recall linode having chat support
[00:09] sholmes: EC2 is Amazon web service?
[00:09] eventi: yeah
[00:10] spaceinvader: this irc is on an ec2
[00:10] spaceinvader: but it doesn't do much else
[00:11] eventi: i have a metric buttload of cloud machines instances... and you seriously get what you pay for
[00:11] sholmes: I thought this IRC is on freenode.net?
[00:11] sholmes: Anyway, I can't do Amazon cause it's too far out of my comfort zone.
[00:12] eventi: then the smallest slicehost
[00:12] eventi: I think $24/month
[00:12] sholmes: I'm used to managing a localhost, would it be similar to managing that?
[00:12] sholmes: Slicehost is 20 a month
[00:12] eventi: dead simple 
[00:12] eventi: sell some cookies
[00:13] aurynn: linode is $20/m
[00:13] sholmes: eventi: well, when I say managing my localhost I mean installing WampServer on my Windows machine. haha
[00:13] eventi: my daughter just made a killing
[00:13] eventi: sholmes: lol
[00:13] sholmes: It shouldn't be much different installing a LAMP stack on a linux VPS right?
[00:14] marcello3d: just install debian or ubuntu or whatever, and you can install everything with aptitude
[00:14] eventi: i see - i don't think you'll get easy, cheap and fast
[00:14] sholmes: well, what could possibly come with the cheap part?
[00:14] marcello3d: $20/m for your own "dedicated" server is pretty cheap ;)
[00:14] eventi: frontpage
[00:15] sholmes: I know 2host is dirt cheap.
[00:15] mscdex: you'd be surprised at recent dirt prices
[00:15] marcello3d: honestly, if you can afford a cell phone, you can probably afford dedicated server hosting
[00:15] marcello3d: if you can't, find another hobby ;)
[00:15] eventi: sholmes: cookies man - GOLDMINE!!
[00:15] sholmes: haha, I'm not paying my cell bills :P
[00:16] marcello3d: setup port forwarding
[00:16] marcello3d: dynip it up
[00:16] mscdex: you can get some pretty cheap prepaid cell phone usage
[00:16] mscdex: :p
[00:16] marcello3d: run everything on your computer
[00:16] sholmes: marcello3d: host my site from my laptop? :\
[00:16] marcello3d: you wouldn't be the first person
[00:16] spaceinvader: sholmes: how old are you?
[00:16] sholmes: nah, I would need a upgrade from my ISP.
[00:17] eventi: sholmes: my first job at an ISP I used to dev the sites in my desktop
[00:17] sholmes: spaceinvader: old enough, ;P
[00:17] spaceinvader: i used to run sites from my uni dorm
[00:17] spaceinvader: http://users.aber.ac.uk/tam9/tmp/rack.jpg

[00:19] sholmes: spaceinvader: that's pretty awesome, but I'm not technically savvy enought yet to be able to manager my own hardware.

[04:14] marcello3d: how do you deal with longs in node.js?
[04:15] torvalamo: there's no built in bigint type in js, so you'll have to use a third party module of some sort
[04:15] marcello3d: ok
[04:16] marcello3d: looks like node-mongodb-native uses google's Long
[04:16] marcello3d: but their gridfs code doesn't actually handle it correctly
[04:17] wao: uii
[04:18] marcello3d: wow, my alt tab launcher is messed up
[04:18] marcello3d: one of the icons is a white square (different app each time)
[04:18] marcello3d: and it randomly adds and removes programs
[04:18] mscdex: :S
[04:18] NuckingFuts: long?
[04:18] NuckingFuts: ACTION doesn't subclassify numbers that much
[04:19] NuckingFuts: The most I worry about is float, double, or int
[04:19] marcello3d: long is usually used for file sizes and times
[04:19] marcello3d: and in the case of mongodb, it's used for filesizes in gridfs
[04:20] marcello3d: not a big deal in java/scala land, but could be problematic here
[04:20] torvalamo: it's not that long itself is wanted, it's that a regular int just doesn't cut it in some cases
[04:20] torvalamo: for NuckingFuts
[04:21] marcello3d: well, and js only has double
[04:21] marcello3d: which is a superset of int, but not long
[04:21] NuckingFuts: lol that's why I don't deal much beyond int and double lol
[04:22] NuckingFuts: Because I am primarily a JS coder :P
[04:22] NuckingFuts: Also, I just discovered JSDoc.  I am documenting the shit out of my code now lol
[04:22] torvalamo: it's not about the language, it's about the app
[04:22] torvalamo: if you app needs large numbers, then you need long (or bigger)
[04:23] NuckingFuts: scientific notation storage XD
[04:23] marcello3d: that's what double is
[04:23] NuckingFuts: orly?

[04:43] MatthewMueller: I'm looking for a good way of taking in a .json file that includes functions, parsing it, then rewriting it back to a json file still including the function code as strings. Does anyone know a good way of doing this>?
[04:45] marcello3d: json doesn't allow functions...
[04:45] NuckingFuts: MatthewMueller: Convert functons to strings shouldn't be hard >_>

[04:47] MatthewMueller: NuckingFuts: Could you please enlighten me if that's the case?
[04:47] marcello3d: you should be able to call toString() on the function
[04:47] marcello3d: to get the string version
[04:48] MatthewMueller: marcello3d: Hm.. okay I'll try that out - thanks!

[04:51] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:52] chapel: ryah: 0.4.0 and it works on small file, but once they are a certain size it just exits out, like it doesn't even happen
[04:52] marcello3d: I think there's a method you can pass to stringify that lets you filter objects
[04:52] marcello3d: if that's the case, you could convert functions to strings on the fly, yourself
[04:52] marcello3d: obviously once they're strings you have no way of knowing they're supposed to be functions again
[04:52] NuckingFuts: marcello3d: eval each one XD
[04:52] NuckingFuts: lolbadpractices
[04:53] MatthewMueller: hahah actually I'm passing it back through the <script> tags so its basically the same thing
[04:53] inimino: MatthewMueller ⋱ Because functions cannot be stringified.
[04:53] chapel: functions can be stringed
[04:54] NuckingFuts: Yeah
[04:54] inimino: MatthewMueller ⋱ toString() loses the closure over free variables in the function.
[04:54] MatthewMueller: chapel: stringed within JSON.stringify()?
[04:54] chapel: v8: function test() { console.log('blah') }; test.toString();
[04:54] v8bot: chapel: "function test() { console.log('blah') }"

[04:56] MatthewMueller: inimino: thanks for the info, I don't think that's a problem for me but we'll see the farther I dive in.
[04:56] marcello3d: v8: var foo=1; function bar() { return foo; }; bar.toString()

[04:58] MatthewMueller: inimino: I'm essentially trying to make models work both client and serverside. So I need to filter out certain functions and values (like password) that the client shouldn't see. Easiest (most error-resistant) is to convert to JSON object, drop some functions and keys, then stringify again and pass down to client.
[04:58] chapel: MatthewMueller
[04:58] chapel: I can save you some time, are you trying to do it dynamically?
[04:58] NuckingFuts: Here, have an explanation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe_and_Everything_.2842.29

[04:59] MatthewMueller: I'm catching <script src = "models/documents"></script>
[04:59] chapel: well
[04:59] chapel: you should look at dnode
[04:59] NuckingFuts: but what is the question?  "What do you get when you multiply five times nine?"
[04:59] chapel: http://github.com/substack/node-dnode
[05:00] MatthewMueller: chapel: oo la la. I'll check it out - I'm trying to get it working with backbone.js fyi
[05:00] chapel: https://github.com/substack/dnode
[05:00] chapel: I have it working with dnode
[05:00] chapel: well for the most part, backbone and dnoe
[05:00] chapel: dnode
[05:01] chapel: still have a few things to do on client to smooth it out, but its really easy to override the Backbone.sync and have it handle dnode functions
[05:01] ossareh_ has joined the channel
[05:01] MatthewMueller: chapel: This looks great - would  you have any resources or code I could check out or no?
[05:01] MatthewMueller: also have you been able to consolidate your views too?
[05:02] chapel: consolidate? in what way?
[05:02] chapel: well atm, my code is rough, but I could gist up a snippet that gives you an idea
[05:03] MatthewMueller: chapel: anything would be great. I'm trying to get this done tonight - I have a good idea how to do it now, but this looks more promising for the future
[05:03] chapel: yeah dnode is awesome
[05:04] chapel: it handles exactly what you are talking about
[05:10] sholmes: Hey, does anyone know what the ramifications are if I purchase a VPS with servers located in Germany?
[05:11] sholmes: Does my business fall under German laws?
[05:11] MatthewMueller: chapel: So this kind of looks like a wrapper for socket.io. I can see this being really useful, but I'm not picturing how to have one set of models this way.
[05:11] sholmes: Is having a US based business with a Germany server have bad latency issues?
[05:11] chapel: MatthewMueller: it is more than a wrapper for socket.io
[05:12] chapel: it does use socket.io for a lot of its stuff
[05:12] sholmes: Sorry for asking these questions here, but I don't know of any other more friendly IRC channels. If you don't want me asking these of topic questions, I understand.
[05:12] chapel: but most of the 'magic' is not related to socket.io
[05:12] chapel: sholmes: its cool, and servers in germany are going to have a higher latency, but it really depends on what you are doing if it will matter
[05:13] sholmes: I'm going to be doing a lot of real-time stuff with Node, such as chat etc.
[05:13] MatthewMueller: chapel: yah, so it calls functions over the wire. I'm looking to have models on my client and server, but client can't have all the same functions and properties as the server
[05:13] sholmes: If it's like a second delay latency, I'm sure I can live with that.
[05:13] sholmes: for now.

[05:15] sholmes: But, I'm talking about legal stuff. Will I have to comply with the German government?
[05:15] sholmes: That's the biggest thing that would concern me.
[05:16] chapel: MatthewMueller: well how I have it setup is I create a function that takes the args I need to get model/s and send that to the remote dnode function on the server, which then returns the model/s
[05:16] sholmes: If it was legal in Germany to take owner ship of any business/service located in Germany, could they just go ahead and take my site?
[05:16] chapel: another way I did it was to send the db functions over to the client, and use them directly there
[05:17] chapel: sholmes: I honestly don't know
[05:17] marcello3d: sholmes: paranoid much?
[05:18] sholmes: marcello3d: haha. I guess that is paranoia. But I really would like to play this safe.
[05:18] marcello3d: get a lawyer if it's a real concern
[05:18] MatthewMueller: chapel: Oh I gotcha. Hm.. I'll look into that approach - thanks a lot.
[05:18] marcello3d: put everything on an encrypted drive
[05:18] chapel: just know that it wont send out prototyped functions by default
[05:18] chapel: you have to explicitly send those
[05:18] chapel: there are a lot of approaches
[05:18] marcello3d: and only allow manual unlocking at boot
[05:18] MatthewMueller: chapel: sounds good, yah
[05:19] sholmes: have you guys ever bought a server out source?
[05:19] sholmes: off shore I mean
[05:19] Aria: I have a VPS in Europe, and one here in the US
[05:20] marcello3d: sholmes: germany could be invaded by russian
[05:20] sholmes: Aria, which pare of Europe?
[05:20] marcello3d: and the russians could take your server hostage
[05:20] Aria: the Netherlands.
[05:20] sholmes: they could take the server all they want. 
[05:20] sholmes: I'll still have the code
[05:20] Aria: marcello3d: You forgot poland!!
[05:20] marcello3d: and demand money for its safe return
[05:20] sholmes: What I'm wondering is if they could take the code.
[05:21] marcello3d: they'll hack the server and sell all your code on the russian black market
[05:21] sholmes: lol
[05:21] marcello3d: it's simple
[05:21] marcello3d: no one wants your code
[05:21] sholmes: The could never take the domain I suppose.
[05:21] sholmes: So even if they took the code, and I built a brand, they couldn't take the brand.
[05:22] marcello3d: if you're making money
[05:22] marcello3d: get your own server
[05:22] Aria: Depending on the domain, and the laws around that.
[05:22] marcello3d: if this is such a big deal to you

[05:22] sholmes: marcello3d: it's not a *big deal*. I'm just curious about this.
[05:22] sholmes: Never thought about it before, so that's why I asked here.
[05:22] Aria: the ways a hostile government can screw with you are endless.
[05:23] sholmes: I think's fine for now. Later I can get an on shore server once I expand.
[05:23] Aria: The ways a non-hostile government will screw with you are much more limited, and they generally stick to taking things used for something they consider illegal.
[05:23] Aria: However, governments are ham-fisted, and do things like back a truck up to a server room and say "We want it all. The warrant says we get it all."
[05:24] marcello3d: you might actually be safer with code outside of the country than in the country

[05:24] sholmes: marcello3d: why do you say that?
[05:24] Aria: Well, the FBI /did/ seize a whole roomful of servers this year from a network center in chicago.
[05:24] marcello3d: because it becomes an international issue
[05:24] marcello3d: if either government tries to get involved
[05:25] lukegalea has joined the channel

[05:25] marcello3d: yes
[05:25] sholmes: Awesome! My site would get so much publicity from that!
[05:25] Aria: Nah, it means you're involved with international law. Which could be for or against you depending on treaties involving commerce between the two countries.
[05:25] sholmes: Darn. No mortal conflict then...
[05:26] marcello3d: just think how much code you could have written in the last 20 minutes of thinking about this

[05:56] sholmes: what's the easiest linux OS to start out with as a newcomer to VPS?
[05:56] hanksims: marcello3d: Yeah, that's what was concerning me from the beginning. Might be the only supersolid way to do this is to fire signals to cron.
[05:56] warz: sholmes, probably ubuntu
[05:56] hanksims: sholmes: Ubuntu gets my vote.
[05:56] sholmes: sounds like a consensus
[05:56] marcello3d: windows 95

[05:59] marcello3d: async question: I want to run two database queries in parallel, and do something when they're both done...how?
[05:59] Aria: Make a list of outstanding transactions and when the last one returns, fire an event or call a callback.
[05:59] Aria: Or if not a list, a counter.
[05:59] marcello3d: how precise?
[06:00] confoocious has joined the channel
[06:00] marcello3d: aria: yea, I get that, but is there a standard/right way to do it in node.js?
[06:00] Aria: Both of those, depending on need ;-)
[06:00] Aria: It's a simple pattern, but one you'll see often.
[06:01] Aria: Not the kind of thing that needs huge infrastructure or a library to do.
[06:01] hanksims: marcello3d: Well, not THAT precise. Gotta have it down to within a second. On the hour, every hour.
[06:01] marcello3d: gotcha
[06:02] marcello3d: node-cron is probably fine, if it actually does have a drift problem, it shouldn't be too hard to have it detect the error and correct when it gets too wide
[06:02] marcello3d: (disclaimer: I've never used node-cron and no idea if it works)
[06:02] marcello3d: aria: but but but!
[06:02] hanksims: I'm gonna stick with the tried and true.
[06:02] marcello3d: it's so unclean D:

[10:23] Ond: No, not .js

[10:25] mscdex: casperionx: what's the calling code look like?

[10:26] Jaye_: dont you love when you think "i wonder if i can..." and sure enough its in the node docs, <3 node
[10:27] casperionx: its basic, but its just to make sure it works

[10:28] casperionx: Effectively, dbslayer for mysql is a proxy for it, which emits a json encoded string as the response data, I am basically trying to make a module that makes it a webservice
[10:28] sholmes: Still, getting the bad file descriptor error.
[10:28] Ond: What file are you rendering? home.ejs?
[10:29] Ond: So, __dirname+/views/home.ejs and __dirname+/views/layout.ejs should exist. 
[10:29] casperionx: I was previously using code from Guille on git for it and it worked on v0.2.6 - Im trying to update it to be workable with v0.4.0
[10:29] casperionx: https://github.com/Guille/node.dbslayer.js/
[10:30] sholmes: What is layout.ejs?
[10:30] sholmes: Why should layout.ejs exist?
[10:30] Ond: <Ond> It's the default layout. If you wanted to render some other .ejs you'd go res.render('filename') and it would inject the result into <%- body%> of layout.ejs 
[10:30] sholmes: hmm.
[10:30] Ond: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples/ejs
[10:31] sholmes: So layout.ejs is a kind of global thing?
[10:31] Ond: Yeah, whatever .ejs you're rendering would be injected into layout.ejs 
[10:31] sholmes: what if you don't want layout.ejs?
[10:31] casperionx: object in module.exports.fetch is {SQL:"select * from mydb"}, and key is = 'RESULT'
[10:31] sholmes: What if you want different layouts?
[10:31] Ond: There may be a way to work around that, sholmes. Never looked around for that 
[10:32] Ond: You generally don't
[10:32] sholmes: :|
[10:32] Ond: layout.ejs can be as basic as <html> <body> <%- body %> </body> </html>
[10:32] sholmes: hmm.
[10:32] sholmes: what about the head?
[10:33] eventi has joined the channel
[10:33] sholmes: Is this only for ejs?
[10:33] sholmes: I mean, does only ejs do this?
[10:33] sholmes: would jade require a layout.ejs?
[10:34] Ond: I dunno, let me look through the express examples on the extremely convenient and accessible github page
[10:35] sholmes: okay, I'll wait till your done.
[10:35] Ond: I notice similar behavior with the other view engines, sholmes.
[10:35] Jaye_: jade uses layout.jade
[10:35] sholmes: Alright. I'll have to get used to this I guess.
[10:37] Jaye_: its that way intentionally so you can specificy different layouts and mixin different pages into each one with render, like render('somepage.jade', {options: layout: secondlayout.jade});

[10:42] afriggeri has joined the channel
[10:42] Jaye_: evet: probably better to use websockets if you can
[10:42] Jaye_: http requests, even xml ones, are expensive time wise
[10:42] casperionx: Websockets + JSON = WIN
[10:44] Evet: websockets + flash fallback = great
[10:44] Jaye_: also take a look at dnode, if you are planning to keep some functionality on the server it makes it a breeze
[10:44] papandreou: mscdex: I replied to your thread about the crypto bug a couple of days ago, but for some reason it didn't make it through. Just wanted to point you to http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-dev/browse_thread/thread/436e5d81e5f4dba3

[10:44] Evet: but some browsers disable websockets by default
[10:44] Evet: or doesnt support
[10:44] casperionx: firefox
[10:45] Jaye_: yeah, if you are using socket.io you will then either end up with flash sockets or.... long-polling
[10:45] casperionx: mscdex, I gave it a try, but I get the following error
[10:45] casperionx: http://pastebin.com/duRTz8ik
[10:45] sholmes: Jaye_, oh I see.
[10:46] papandreou: mscdex: Apparently ryah tried to hunt it down, but gave up and decided to remove crypto from core because it's so broken: http://nodejs.debuggable.com/2011-01-26.txt
[10:46] mscdex: well, it's not removed yet
[10:47] mscdex: it's only a bug with base64 encoding/decoding though
[10:47] Evet: does local AJAX polling perform better than cross-domain JSONP polling?
[10:47] mscdex: i tried hunting it down too the other day, but didn't get very far before giving up
[10:47] mscdex: heh
[10:47] papandreou: mscdex: So did aklt (he's my colleague)
[10:48] sholmes: How could I pass options to my layouts? My different pages will need a way to pass in information for the head part of my layout, such as a title.
[10:48] papandreou: mscdex: I think he spent a couple of days and even found a workaround, then realized it was an even deeper issue

[11:05] Jaye_: got a debugger? run your script in debug mode and take a look in http.js
[11:07] mscdex: just for kicks, maybe try inserting this right inside the fetch function: console.dir(require('http').get);
[11:07] mscdex: see what that outputs

[11:09] casperionx: undefined is what I get before it errors
[11:10] mscdex: ok yeah something is definitely messed up then
[11:10] casperionx: I am using node version manager to run 0.4.0
[11:10] mscdex: it's defined in the repl and not in the code?
[11:10] casperionx: Yeah
[11:11] mscdex: maybe nvm is having some issue
[11:11] sholmes: I come from a PHP background, and am loving Node so far. However, how do I get information similar to $_SERVER in PHP, specifically the $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']?
[11:11] mscdex: that's the only thing i can think of

[11:16] sholmes: I know there's set('view options')
[11:16] sholmes: but whenever a .render passes locals it'll override the view options settings.
[11:17] sholmes: is there a way to make sure the options merge?
[11:17] Jaye_: not that i know of
[11:17] Jaye_: i havent used express in a while though
[11:17] mscdex: casperionx: dunno about that one, it looks alright to me
[11:18] casperionx: I am using nvm to use variations of ndoe
[11:18] casperionx: node
[11:19] casperionx: maybe I should uninstall my old node and update to the new one, but really silly questions, is how does one update the node he is using to the latest version, is it as simple as downloading the git, and making it?
[11:20] mscdex: and then make install
[11:20] mscdex: yep
[11:21] Jaye_: ./configure && make install ftw
[11:22] casperionx: I come from a windows background, so node is a bit of an adventure.
[11:22] casperionx: but I love working with javascript as a backend tool, it saves data conversion massively
[11:22] Jaye_: seems like most people use the default install to /usr/local, everything else breaks :( i had similar troubles to yours when i installed node with homebrew
[11:23] mscdex: i always compile node myself
[11:23] casperionx: I thought nvm - node version manager would save me the trouble.

[11:24] mscdex: i've never personally used nvm, i just upgrade my version of node as new stable releases come out
[11:25] Jaye_: ya same, i just git pull and remake it
[11:25] mscdex: and just use unstable versions locally
[11:25] mscdex: e.g. ./node

[12:25] sholmes: eventi: sorry. What I mean is, putting stuff within configure callback when that configure doesn't have an environment variable, is the same as taking out whatever you put inside the callback and not having the configure call at all.

[16:35] lukegalea: as compared to Ruby
[16:35] lukegalea: it's not full featured..
[16:35] lukegalea: whereas Jade is.
[16:35] marcello3d: what is haml missing that jade has?
[16:36] marcello3d: as far as I can tell the two modules are written by the same people?

[16:36] sholmes: Hey guys.
[16:36] marcello3d: haml has the advantage of being syntax highlighted in intellij nicely

[16:37] lukegalea: I've found that != doesn't work in haml-js, nor does the syntax for commenting..
[16:37] lukegalea: trying to remember what else..
[16:37] sholmes: marceollo3d: oh nos not the server!
[16:37] lukegalea: I'm sure there's *some* way to make it work, but if you are used to Ruby HAML you'll find it's not quite right.
[16:37] sholmes: "Error: session() middleware requires the "secret" option string for security" wtf?
[16:37] marcello3d: I'm not used to ruby haml
[16:37] marcello3d: new to all of that :)
[16:38] lukegalea: well, I guess the other thing is that Jade is just better ;)

[16:38] marcello3d: ok
[16:38] sholmes: ejs does the job. :\
[16:38] lukegalea: the syntax is nicer.. it's like a CSS selector
[16:38] franck34: sholmes: somebody here tell me it's better to use sesame() rather than connect.session(). Tested : it's better yes
[16:38] ceej: franck34: https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io-node/issues/issue/139
[16:38] marcello3d: how do you do layouts?

[16:39] perlmonkey2: Anyone with a lot of nosql experience have anything to say on some of its difficulties or what sucks the worst about using it?
[16:39] franck34: ceej: cool. Making a pause and i'll take a look
[16:39] lukegalea: marcello3d: If you are using express, you can just have a layout.jade file.. and the renderer will automatically use that. (or you can say res.render({layout: 'someotherfile.jade'})
[16:39] marcello3d: aha
[16:39] sholmes: franck34, link?
[16:39] lukegalea: marcello3d: and you can also just include other jade files via partials

[16:40] lukegalea: marcello3d: layout is probably what you want.. res.render( 'somefile.jade', { layout: 'thelayout.jade' })

[16:45] Connorhd has joined the channel
[16:45] ceej: in 6.8 flashsockets works for IE, long polling does not... it actually stays connected for one message
[16:45] franck34: "long polling", can you be a little bit more precise ? 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling','jsonp-polling ?
[16:46] ceej: xhr-polling

[16:48] sholmes: franck34: sesame looks pretty killer.
[16:48] sholmes: But what confuses me with any session is the storage system.
[16:49] franck34: sholmes: yep, simple and stupid but working !!
[16:49] sholmes: what's a good persistent storage?
[16:49] franck34: ceej: can you precise in github your node versio, ?
[16:49] franck34: sholmes: redis
[16:49] sholmes: why?
[16:49] franck34: really fast (more than memcached) 
[16:49] franck34: and so simple to use for session ..
[16:50] sholmes: what about supermarket or nStore?
[16:50] franck34: i didn't test them
[16:50] ceej: franck34: added (I'm using v.0.4.0)
[16:50] franck34: i just know redis is the fatest
[16:50] marcello3d: franck: would you use it over mongodb?
[16:50] franck34: ceej: same here
[16:50] franck34: marcello3d: not yet, i have to test mongo
[16:50] chakrit has joined the channel

[16:51] franck34:  but i'll for sure
[16:51] marcello3d: interesting :)
[16:51] sholmes: I'll use SQL for long term stuff
[16:51] marcello3d: mongodb has some nice querying support
[16:51] sholmes: and redis for session stuff
[16:52] marcello3d: I haven't tried redis though
[16:52] franck34: sholmes: i think sesame can store directly in a file if you want
[16:52] franck34: sholmes: sesame got an embed session storage system
[16:52] Jaye_: mongodb is also very fast for a document store
[16:52] sholmes: I searched github for redis and got a whole bunch. What is the official redis npm package?

[17:04] marcello3d: 64bit if you can afford it, I'd say
[17:04] sholmes: it's all the same price, 
[17:05] marcello3d: afford it in cpu specs
[17:05] marcello3d: I'd do 64bit/10.10, just to have more cutting edge
[17:05] narph has joined the channel
[17:05] marcello3d: the only reason to use an older os is the new one is not considered stable or you have existing battletested systems on the previous os

[17:14] marcello3d: what's hiredis?
[17:14] franck34: a node bind to a native C client lib for redis
[17:14] franck34: fatest one
[17:14] aurynn: there's a couple of redis clients
[17:15] franck34: yep
[17:16] franck34: but after speaking on #redis, somebody tell me the fastest and robuste way is 'redis'+hiredis (redis will use hiredis if available)
[17:16] skm has joined the channel
[17:17] franck34: 16:28 < dspezia> there is an excellent client for node.js (Matt Ranney's one)
[17:17] franck34: 16:28 < dspezia> this is the faster you can find for node - still it is about three times as slow as a pure C hiredis-based client
[17:17] franck34: 16:30 < dspezia> this is expected of course - it is hard to beat C at raw speed ...

[17:38] marcello3d: I would imagine
[17:39] augustl: sounds unlikely of node to keep the data until someone subscribes to it..
[17:39] marcello3d: yes
[17:39] marcello3d: but presumably the request is made on nextTick

[17:42] marcello3d: is data a string?
[17:42] marcello3d: I'd probably use an array
[17:43] marcello3d: and then just re-emit the events from the cache once you add anything
[17:43] marcello3d: or at least
[17:43] marcello3d: manually run the callback with the elements in the array before adding the listener
[17:44] marcello3d: you'll want to remove that listener, as well

[17:44] anykey: marcello3d: well it seems html is really the only option. thanks for input.

[18:46] bingomanatee: yes and no respectively.
[18:46] bingomanatee: If you are on windows you are kind of hosed. Best to get off into mysql or nosql if you are interested in node.

[20:02] TereskaPL: hello. i need to know more about fs.readFileSync. for example: if i use standard http module with createServer and in that i use readFileSync i will block new connections?
[20:04] Imperion has joined the channel
[20:05] franck34: TereskaPL: good question. Block only the client or the all server ? ...
[20:05] marcello3d: tereska: it will block the node.js instance
[20:06] marcello3d: most likely the connections will still be made, but they won't be handled until the readFileSync finishes
[20:06] marcello3d: I'm guessing you really only want to use readFileSync for application initialization and commandline utilities
[20:07] marcello3d: and it's pretty easy to use the async version
[20:07] TereskaPL: ok thanks
[20:07] franck34: wait, it depend of your node setup
[20:07] TereskaPL: i want to know if it will block server
[20:08] TereskaPL: ?
[20:08] marcello3d: franck: it will block a single node.js instance
[20:08] marcello3d: right?
[20:08] franck34: right, a single node.js instance
[20:08] marcello3d: obviously if you have a pool of node.js's, the other ones will continue
[20:08] marcello3d: but even then you shouldn't use readfilesync
[20:08] franck34: so if you got more than one, pool of node.js ... yes you got it marcello3d 
[20:08] marcello3d: because you're defeating the whole point of node.js :)
[20:08] TereskaPL: ok i will try use async version of fileread
[20:08] TereskaPL: :)
[20:09] franck34: better way ;)

[20:19] Yuffster has joined the channel
[20:19] marcello3d: I've been using scss
[20:19] marcello3d: on play/scala
[20:19] Aria: scss seems neat, sass seems pythonish, and I've not used stylus.
[20:19] Aria: Stylistically, I don't like sass so much.
[20:19] sholmes: marcello3d: that's what I'm thinking. The worst that can happen: I get hack and all the data is stolen, then I switch to Debian. xP
[20:19] marcello3d: yea, ditto
[20:19] Aria: But it's a gut reaction, not a measured one.
[20:19] marcello3d: well the nice thing about scss is you can paste css in verbatim
[20:19] marcello3d: and it's legal
[20:19] Aria: Yeah. Exactly.
[20:20] aho: also, mixins dont look like regular classes
[20:20] Aria: sholmes: That's the wrong way to think about security. You have to think about what you're securing from whom, and what has to stay working for whom -- and make appropriate tradeoffs. 
[20:20] aho: that was my primary reason to pick it over less
[20:20] marcello3d: ok
[20:20] marcello3d: so do you guys use this? http://search.npmjs.org/#/scss
[20:20] sholmes: Aria: that's not what marcello3d says.
[20:20] marcello3d: or some other implementation?
[20:21] chrischr_ has joined the channel
[20:21] marcello3d: I don't like how npm registry doesn't have links to source/websites
[20:21] marcello3d: they should make that a requirement for submissions
[20:21] Aria: There is no automatic "more secure" knob -- if there was, everyone would just turn it to 11 and forget it. Security means knowing what you're securing, and why someone would want it.
[20:22] marcello3d: sholmes: you're more likely to have security problems from not keeping your server up to date, and from writing bad code
[20:22] marcello3d: than picking the "wrong" distribution
[20:22] Aria: Indeed. 
[20:22] marcello3d: there are a number of "best practices" on securing a server
[20:22] Aria: All of the break-ins I've had have been users with crappy passwords, or web apps that allow remote code execution. (Thanks, lousy PHP developers)
[20:23] marcello3d: and they basically come down to limiting access (firewall everything, don't allow root ssh, careful with who has sudo access, good passwords)
[20:23] marcello3d: minimize the programs/services you're running to minimize risk
[20:23] marcello3d: and keep an eye out on security advisories, and understand their implications
[20:23] Aria: (And I'm not so sure on the 'firewall everything' -- in most cases, just not running too many services does the same thing.)
[20:24] marcello3d: well it's just another level of protection
[20:24] Aria: (Unless you have a 'smart' firewall, and then you have to understand what it'll lock you out of if you screw up -- and whether THAT is a security problem.)
[20:24] marcello3d: heh
[20:24] bronson: A good framework for a node-driven single-page app?  Is Express the best game in town?
[20:24] Aria: (I consider "does it stay working?" a security problem. Slamming the doors on your customers or the equivalent is, in my opinion, a security flaw. A self-imposed DoS attack.
[20:24] bronson: Just looking for alternatives.
[20:24] Aria: )
[20:25] marcello3d: iptables is not that complicated
[20:25] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[20:25] Aria: bronson: It's certainly good. Though 'single page' could be done with the raw HTTP service, too.
[20:25] marcello3d: you basically set it up once, and you'er good
[20:25] perezd has joined the channel
[20:25] marcello3d: it lets you know explicitly what's being allowed in and out
[20:25] Aria: Yes, but what does it get you beyond "Uh... you can't connect to that port ... " whether "Because I said so" or "because there's nothing there"
[20:25] Aria: Hehe. I have netstat for that ;-)
[20:26] marcello3d: slicehost has this nice feature where you can get tty access to your box, even if eth0/ssh is down/blocked
[20:26] Aria: Indeed. Virtual consoles rock.
[20:26] Aria: (I have that via an old cisco router and a serial cable on my physical machines)
[20:26] Aria: (It's crufty but it works.)
[20:26] Aria: (And it has saved my bacon SO MANY times.)
[20:26] marcello3d: netstat only helps you at the moment, though?
[20:27] marcello3d: it's not a guarantee
[20:27] Aria: Sure. But iptables is just as dynamic a system ;-)
[20:27] bronson: Aria, true.  Just trying to write (and DEBUG) as little of my own code as possible.
[20:27] Aria: But I admin a cpanel host with a reactive firewall -- and at least ten times a week, someone's locked out by it. There is no single security policy that works for it.
[20:27] marcello3d: bronson: read the guide, if the style appeals to you, I say go for it
[20:27] franck34: do you know the equivalent of utf8_decode/encode (php) in node?

[20:29] JimBastard: coming up
[20:29] sriley: #! is a badly broken fe architecture
[20:29] Aria: marcello3d: And associated sockets. And the ones to the flash socket port, and ...

[20:30] bronson: sriley, I know, I read that blog post too.
[20:30] marcello3d: aria: would you suggest running no firewall at all?
[20:31] Aria: marcello3d: I run none. But I /do/ get a note when new listening ports open.
[20:31] marcello3d: over being aware of how sockets work and what's going on?

[20:31] sriley: i wasnt talking about the blog post in particular, but yes it wrote up what most fe developers were thinking hence the responses about it
[20:31] Aria: cron + netstat + diff 
[20:31] marcello3d: ah :)
[20:32] bronson: sriley, but, for a SPA, what's a good alternative?
[20:32] marcello3d: ok
[20:32] marcello3d: back to my original question
[20:32] Aria: Low-fi but works really well. And y'know what? Alarm bells so often beat thinking you've secured everything and then not noticing.
[20:32] marcello3d: http://search.npmjs.org/#/scss <- recommended, no? does anyone know where the source/website is?
[20:32] Aria: https://encrypted.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=scss+node&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 -- second link
[20:33] marcello3d: hmmm weird, it wasn't coming up on duckduck go
[20:33] sriley: pushState is a better alternative, the #! was implemented to allow broken fe architectures a life line to get indexed
[20:33] Aria: Though it'd be nice if the interface there showed the username of the publisher.
[20:33] Aria: you'd have seen 'bmavity' that way.

[20:35] marcello3d: not on ddg
[20:35] dguttman has joined the channel
[20:35] marcello3d: does express or connect provide a standard way to do file filters?
[20:35] marcello3d: e.g. kinda like the static provider, but it runs the files through a filter/caches, first?
[20:35] sriley: no its ff4, but there is a history.js that does backwards compat with the crappy #! stuff
[20:35] marcello3d: or another way, how do people handle scss compiling/caching
[20:36] bronson: hm, I can live with that

[20:43] franck34: you make the point. Today, we don't know what is the more popular modules

[20:43] marcello3d: actually
[20:44] marcello3d: a better middlewhere would probably hash the source for part of the url

[20:50] bingomanatee: franck34: you should really dig .NET. 
[20:51] Pholder: And is there a way I can run my node server as ./server instead of node server.js?
[20:51] marcello3d: someone needs to write an app to socially rank modules
[20:51] franck34: Pholder: yes: wait

[20:52] jesusabdullah: I would've gone to the bbq
[20:52] bingomanatee: how is it advertised?
[20:52] bronson: jsbbq.org  :)

[20:53] jesusabdullah: Pholder: Should be pretty easy to organize something. Talk to the nodejitsu guys; there's 7 attendees right there
[20:53] mynyml: not in SF at least
[20:53] jesusabdullah: Liar.
[20:53] easternbloc: surely you have some heat
[20:53] franck34: saschagehlich: welcome to broken socket.io atm
[20:53] easternbloc: how do you have a bbq without heat
[20:53] marcello3d: is there a node.js nyc meetup group?
[20:54] jesusabdullah: The bay area is continuously toasty
[20:54] franck34: bingomanatee: really dig .NET ??
[20:54] saschagehlich: franck34: that's crap since I use it in production on a "huge" website. users are flaming :/
[20:54] bingomanatee: well if you only want one way to solve everything, .NET is for you
[20:54] marcello3d: http://www.meetup.com/nodejs/
[20:54] jesusabdullah: I live in the frigid northern wastes

[20:54] marcello3d: is in brooklyn
[20:54] mynyml: i miss having a real summer o.O
[20:54] easternbloc: I'm sure compared to england its tshirt warm for me
[20:54] franck34: saschagehlich: switch back to 0.8.6, ceej did it
[20:54] easternbloc: which is all I need
[20:54] jesusabdullah: Oh shitdicks, it's -40 out today
[20:54] jesusabdullah: no joke
[20:55] easternbloc: haha
[20:55] ceej: 0.6.8
[20:55] marcello3d: C or F?
[20:55] ceej: :)
[20:55] jesusabdullah: marcello3d: That's where the scales cross.
[20:55] bronson: jesusabdullah, good day to get some work done.
[20:55] bingomanatee: Well I RSVPd anyway. Hopefully I will get in the next time. 
[20:55] saschagehlich: so that one works fine?(except from the flash stuff which I don't use at all)
[20:55] franck34: bingomanatee: is it a joke ? do you wana i explain you about the race condition which is by default on all .NET http client sending header Expect: 100 Continue ?
[20:55] augustl: hmm. client.query("BEGIN;", function () {}); -- in node-postgres, that callback is never called, for some reason.
[20:55] Pholder: We'll "Node York City"
[20:55] augustl: is BEGIN etc special?
[20:55] Pholder: We'll call it "Node York City"
[20:55] jesusabdullah: :D
[20:56] bingomanatee: You were the one who complained about there being more than one way to solve everything with node.js.
[20:56] bingomanatee: If that is your "problem" then .NET is your "solution." 
[20:56] bingomanatee: If you don't want to think about your problem, Microsoft is for you. 
[20:56] franck34: it's an illusion
[20:57] bingomanatee: I'm sorry I can't make you happy
[20:57] augustl: brianc: ping (see above) :)
[20:57] franck34: i'm working at bee-ware, a company selling a security product. 70% of opened tickets are about microsoft products
[20:58] marcello3d: cute name
[20:58] jesusabdullah: :3
[20:58] saschagehlich: franck34: 0.6.8 isn't working either
[20:58] jesusabdullah: 70%? That's insane
[20:58] saschagehlich: fuck it :(
[20:58] marcello3d: well
[20:58] jesusabdullah: Doing it live, saschagehlich ?
[20:58] marcello3d: if you think about it
[20:58] marcello3d: 90% of computers are windows
[20:58] jesusabdullah: Yeah, true
[20:58] marcello3d: 70% would imply windows is MORE secure ;D

[20:59] marcello3d: but 90% of software products in use might be
[20:59] marcello3d: windows, office, internet explorer
[20:59] marcello3d: that covers what most people use ;)
[21:00] jesusabdullah: In my head I was ignoring windows proper and thinking that, in between office, ie, messenger, etc...
[21:00] franck34: i'm only speaking about web applications
[21:00] marcello3d: oh, solitaire, and can't forget minesweeper
[21:00] bingomanatee: If it weren't for Microsoft/intel we wouldn't have cheap PCs to install Ubuntu on. 
[21:00] Ond: 90% is unlikely. But more likely is that microsoft users don't know what they're doing and are inclined to open tickets

[21:02] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[21:02] Pholder: bingomanatee: Here's the weird thing: When I commented out my pg.connect call to node-postgres, I was able to process the POST data
[21:02] bingomanatee: I would walk the request variable's properties one by one and iteratively echo them 
[21:02] possibilities has joined the channel
[21:02] Pholder: But otherwise, the call to the async form data parser function would never call my callback!
[21:03] bingomanatee: I very much doubt that node is failing to register your variables at all. 
[21:03] Pholder: bingomanatee: Where does the request variable keep POST data?
[21:03] bingomanatee: Also you can get the raw post body and look at that to see if your form data is submitting properly. 
[21:03] Pholder: request.post?
[21:03] bingomanatee: I use express and in express its request.body.[field name]. 
[21:03] Pholder: Where would I get taht?
[21:03] bingomanatee: expressjs.com
[21:03] Pholder: *that

[21:23] lukes: Aria: weirdly even when i run 'node examples/tour.js' from the actual redis-node git repo it says it can't find the module

[22:04] polotek: maybe google is leaving out some optional data to save a few bytes

[22:31] dingomanatee: I'll put an install documentaiton on the git to help with the setup but you'll want to get node and mongodb working on your local stack. 
[22:31] dingomanatee: it runs on node v. 0.2.6

[22:34] killfill: is there a build-in way to clone an object?.. 
[22:35] Evet_ has joined the channel
[22:35] jetienne: killfill: it was sys.extend. dunno the new api
[22:35] mape: killfill: what does the object contain?
[22:35] dingomanatee: you can use _.extend - however it is not guaranteed to give you a "clean" clone 
[22:36] dingomanatee: part of the challenge of cloning is that you want even subobjects to be unique - not sure how _.extend handles that. 
[22:36] killfill: oh it contains just values. no functions in there
[22:36] mape: var new = JSON.parse(JSON.stingify(old));
[22:36] dingomanatee: If you are just talking scalars _.extend should work. 
[22:36] dingomanatee: (the underscore library)
[22:36] jetienne: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.0/api/util.html#util.inherits killfill
[22:36] dingomanatee: or that.l 
[22:36] killfill: all righty thanks!

[22:38] mape: *performance
[22:39] marcello3d: I'd hate to see JSON.parse(JSON.stingify( littered through code though
[22:39] marcello3d: at the very least abstract it to some clone module so you can improve it later
[22:39] mape: make a wrapper

[22:52] polotek: yeah I modified underscores extend method
[22:52] dingomanatee: Okay Field?
[22:52] polotek: jessica-m: probably has something to do with urls
[22:52] dingomanatee: __.extend :D
[22:52] polotek: spaces can be "+" in urls
[22:53] polotek: and might get converted back by some filter
[22:53] mscdex: %20!
[22:53] mscdex: :p
[22:53] dingomanatee: Field: ping?
[22:53] field: dingomanatee: Yep, saw that. I can't get to work just yet but I'll try to get something going this week.
[22:53] jessica-m: what should i do instead?
[22:53] polotek: mscdex: yeah I try to stick to true encoding
[22:53] tanepiper: i still think .copy on an object should be in ECMAScript, but i keep getting told it would be pointless - but it is a common enough issue :D  just have a paramter for shallow/deep copy i say
[22:53] dingomanatee: no problem - I recommited the readme for better documentation in getting started. 
[22:53] field: cool, thanks
[22:53] polotek: jessica-m: find out what the actual problem is :)
[22:53] polotek: that was just a guess
[22:54] jessica-m: well i dont know where it is getting converted
[22:54] polotek: tanepiper: why pointless?
[22:54] polotek: if it was native it would be really fast
[22:54] field: now for my bertrand russel paper. field out.
[22:54] polotek: could probably take some interpreter shortcuts
[22:54] polotek: would be awesome
[22:54] tanepiper: polotek: well yea that was my argument
[22:55] tanepiper: but i was told it has too manyedge cases between shallow/deep copying
[22:55] jessica-m: its getting to the server fine, but when it comes back to JS its getting converted to a space
[22:55] jessica-m: hmm
[22:55] jessica-m: hang on
[22:55] tanepiper: which is think can be agreed upon and solved, but i have no sway with ECMA so I'm not going to argue it
[22:55] brian_irish: Is there a quick reason why I'd be getting this error with jsdom? http://dpaste.org/wg4Q/
[22:55] AAA_awright: tanepiper: Right, it's that I haven't ever needed to do such a deep clone like that
[22:55] polotek: the only thing to really worry about is circular references
[22:55] tanepiper: AAA_awright: me neither
[22:55] dingomanatee: tanepiper - the mozilla guy who presented on core changes might be flexible on that - he presented in Google last week. Sounds like they are getting pretty heavy on refactoring Javascript to stamp out "bad parts"

[22:56] polotek: deep copy in js sucks in the browser
[22:56] polotek: especially since Object.keys isn't standard
[22:57] polotek: so you have to do the hasOwnProperty stuff
[22:57] polotek: screw that
[22:57] polotek: correction
[22:57] tanepiper: hmm, maybe I should throw something up on my blog then have some of you comment on it :D
[22:57] polotek: Object.keys is standard, just not well supported
[22:57] dingomanatee: These insidious ** things really do belong in core IMHO

[22:58] mscdex: i don't think you can unfreeze an object

[23:00] polotek: marcello3d: yes, js is single-threaded
[23:00] tanepiper: marcello3d: yes, but i said maybe :) I just had a nasty example recently, so i would just want to make sure
[23:00] polotek: but I know v8 in particular does weird things
[23:01] marcello3d: sounds like quantum mechanics ;D
[23:01] tanepiper: for example, I have a global db connection object for couchdb, but then i want to copy it and make a per-user instance, and i want to ensure i don't destroy the glocal connection in anyway
[23:02] tanepiper: because it's used to create new dbs + users, and do adminy things
[23:02] inimino: polotek ⋱ It's well supported enough, just use the "polyfill".

[23:23] James_tKirk: who the hell cares what Madonna thinks? She needs to take up knitting and attend charity events and bad reality TV shows like all the other washed up 80's has beens. 
[23:23] NuckingFuts: I'm thinking I could use self-executing closure functions which would return the object, and have the scope set to the main object :V
[23:24] LadyGaga: Once my new album takes off with a kickstart from my Grammys antics, I will be just like Madonna!
[23:24] aklt: Yeah, well, some I have read
[23:24] James_tKirk: NuckingFuts: I think functional composition is the pattern you are looking for.
[23:24] LadyGaga: James_tKirk: Madonna is not a mere mortal, she is a constant force in the universe that's not subject to pedestrian human constructs like time.
[23:25] James_tKirk: new dAmmn(user, pass). login().getCookie();

[23:25] James_tKirk: Madonna is a mimeograph machine in an age of mashups. 
[23:25] James_tKirk: She was a third rate whore in the 80's, shes a sad aging whore in now. 
[23:27] aklt: I would like to be able to do something like this: require('./myModule').addFunctions(this, [...]), but I am unsure how
[23:27] James_tKirk: Her only accomplishment was to remarket the image of icons who were old enough for her teenagers to think the reference was original. 
[23:27] LadyGaga: James_tKirk: You're wrong about that: http://www.mobilemp4.co.cc/madonnas_back.jpg
[23:27] aklt: ...the addFunctions(0 call should add the functions from the module into the current scope
[23:27] LadyGaga: aklt: You can write an addFunctions function in the module and append it to the exports
[23:27] James_tKirk: If you are feeling brave you can just assign functionality directly. 
[23:27] aklt: LadyGaga: Yeah, I tried, but until now I have not been successfuk
[23:27] LadyGaga: aklt: Where are you adding the functions?
[23:28] aklt: successful :-)
[23:28] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[23:28] James_tKirk: var f = require('./foo'); f.bar = function() {}. 
[23:28] James_tKirk: There is no need for any more complexity unless you want to enforce decoration or something. 
[23:28] aklt: James_tKirk: I want to make that less verbose with the addFunctions call
[23:28] James_tKirk: Because module objects are singletones, you can modify them once and the changes will be available everywhere. 
[23:29] James_tKirk: so just have  function add_function(path, function, callback) ?
[23:30] James_tKirk: You could just do a slew of modification with _.extend(require('./foo'), require('./bar')) which would add all of bar's functionality to foo. 
[23:30] LadyGaga: Do you guys think web apps need uniform UI elements?
[23:30] aklt: yeah, i think i have the idea,.. let e try!
[23:30] James_tKirk: interesting question. 
[23:31] LadyGaga: Every web app has a different way of exposing UI
[23:31] James_tKirk: YUI has a gallery of proven design patterns.
[23:31] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: No, I don't mean functional stuff. I want Login to be an object essentially.
[23:31] James_tKirk: I think jQuery does a gamely job of trying. I wish jQuery were a little more complete, like YUI
[23:31] James_tKirk: oh - you want components. 
[23:31] NuckingFuts: Also, YUI has a shitty UI
[23:31] NuckingFuts: Like, the most hideous Web 2.0 failure ever
[23:32] LadyGaga: That's the problem
[23:32] James_tKirk: Yes - that is true
[23:32] James_tKirk: I think the YUI team tried at least to catalog UI conventions, but I don't llike their output. 
[23:32] NuckingFuts: I think the problem is that they try to make huge UI libraries, when all I want is a simple thing
[23:32] James_tKirk: jQuery has slicker output but a weaker gallery of UI components. 
[23:32] NuckingFuts: It doesn't need to be fancy or anything, I just want a SIMPLE RESULT.
[23:33] NuckingFuts: I will do the CSS, TYVM
[23:33] LadyGaga: Isn't YUI trying too hard to copy 2003esque-look desktop apps?
[23:33] James_tKirk: My though on that - are you talking specifically abgout whether NODE needs a set of UI components?
[23:33] NuckingFuts: Node can't have a UI system, it's server-side
[23:33] NuckingFuts: It would be cool to expose those APIs tho
[23:33] James_tKirk: yes but express can :D
[23:33] LadyGaga: James_tKirk: Not node specifically, and NuckingFuts is right
[23:33] LadyGaga: Is Express ajaxy by default?
[23:33] James_tKirk: its nothing by default. 
[23:34] samsonjs has joined the channel
[23:34] NuckingFuts: I think it'd be nice to see an addon to expose those APIs
[23:34] James_tKirk: It has no model - ergo it has no standard of data throughput. 
[23:34] Aria: Express is an http server framework. AJAX talks to ... http servers.
[23:34] Aria: So ... yes?
[23:34] LadyGaga: Okay, not what I mean then
[23:34] mkrecny has joined the channel
[23:34] Aria: I mean, even when AJAX isn't A, nor X...
[23:34] LadyGaga: What is there to help me load parts of pages AJAX without reloading other stuff like header/footer?
[23:34] NuckingFuts: Maybe with a nice jQuery-esque way of accessing and modifying UI
[23:35] James_tKirk: AJAJ? slips off the tongue nicely
[23:35] NuckingFuts: so I could chain functions, etc.
[23:35] Aria: LadyGaga: There's jquery and prototype and ... this is not a server's problem.
[23:35] LadyGaga: Aria: It becomes the server's problem if you want to somehow create a marriage between client-code and server-code concurrently
[23:35] James_tKirk: I think that I would like to see REST as a standard being used more - that would make it easier to define consistent UI components. 
[23:35] NuckingFuts: I'd LOVE to see a Node UI library that would let me use jQuery's selector engine :D 
[23:35] James_tKirk: This is what I would like to see:
[23:36] Aria: NuckingFuts: What sort of UI?
[23:36] mkrecny: LadyGaga with jQuery serverCallback:function(data){$('some_dom_el').text/innerHTML(data);}
[23:36] mkrecny: kinda thing
[23:36] NuckingFuts: Aria: A native application UI
[23:36] lukegalea has joined the channel
[23:36] James_tKirk: I would like to see (and am working on) express MVC components that define a consistent REST interface to data that is not dependant on any specific respository. 
[23:36] MattDiPasquale has joined the channel
[23:36] Aria: Ah, fun.
[23:36] Aria: Kinda like XUL + jQuery ;-)
[23:36] James_tKirk: I would then like to see a jQuery set of components that works with that sort of a system and can be extended.
[23:36] James_tKirk: Like Dojo without the suck. 
[23:37] NuckingFuts: Aria: Yeah, but with less bloat ;)
[23:37] Aria: Hehe. XUL isn't so bad. Shame about the rest of the engine.
[23:37] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: lol yeah Dojo without the suck would be nice
[23:37] James_tKirk: I'm not sure anything would be left over :D but Dojo tried really hard to establish a set of construction standards 
[23:37] NuckingFuts: Aria: XUL is shit because it's so strict.  Same reason I hate XML.  I am of the opinion that if an error is recoverable, you should recover from it.
[23:37] James_tKirk: The end result was for some reson grindingly unusable. 
[23:37] LadyGaga: Traditionally, server-side code and client-side code are mutually exclusive. Anyone know of attempts to merge them? Especially since node is JS
[23:38] Aria: Hehe. Indeed .Time for an XML5 parser, NuckingFuts!
[23:38] NuckingFuts: Especially when you're like "HEY LOOK THIS IS THE ERROR, YOU FORGOT A /, BUT IT WOULDN'T BREAK SHIT."
[23:38] James_tKirk: I think that letting go of XML is not a big leap
[23:38] NuckingFuts: "BUT I'M GONNA FAIL ANYWAYS, CAUSE I'M A BITCH"
[23:38] NuckingFuts: That's what I think of XML.
[23:38] James_tKirk: if Node were as rest compliant as RoR then RoR and / or Node could be used as consistent data providers 
[23:39] LadyGaga: And you have the whole problem of having to escape lots of crap with XML
[23:39] NuckingFuts: Aria: XML5?
[23:39] James_tKirk: and you could write a set of UI compoents that spoke to either system. 
[23:39] LadyGaga: With XML, you have to escape <, ?, and qutoes
[23:39] NuckingFuts: LadyGaga: Oh right.
[23:39] NuckingFuts: Yeah, it's retarded.
[23:39] Aria: NuckingFuts: Google it. It's basically the idea of using an error-correcting parser for XML-arbitrary data.
[23:39] James_tKirk: And you could design a system like that and make it useful without a whole lot of wastage. 
[23:39] Aria: Like the HTML5 parser, only generalized and minus the tweaks.
[23:39] NuckingFuts: XML is just absolutely awful with the strictness.
[23:39] James_tKirk: ACTION hates negative tangents
[23:39] NuckingFuts: Aria: I would love that.
[23:39] LadyGaga: So, can anyone tell me of any attempts to merge client-side dev with server-side dev? It seems node would be perfect for this
[23:40] James_tKirk: Almost every client side library does this to some extent. 
[23:40] NuckingFuts: Aria: Somebody needs to make a NodeJS module that would let us use XUL.
[23:40] srid has joined the channel
[23:40] srid has joined the channel
[23:40] NuckingFuts: But with a more lax parser, hopefully
[23:40] Aria: That'd be fun. Though I'd rather use GTK.
[23:40] NuckingFuts: Aria: GTK?
[23:41] Aria: The UI library.
[23:41] NuckingFuts: How's GTK handle UI elements?
[23:41] Aria: Well.
[23:41] Aria: (It's a pretty well designed library.)
[23:41] NuckingFuts: I never quite understood how most UI libs worked
[23:41] NuckingFuts: I'm so used to the 3-way division of content/style/action in web development
[23:41] Aria: ACTION laughs. 
[23:41] Aria: That's a new split, and borrowed (badly) from UI libraries.
[23:42] James_tKirk: ACTION thought GTK was for apps, not browsers
[23:42] NuckingFuts: It's actually a good split :P
[23:42] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: That's what I'm talking about
[23:42] NuckingFuts: Native UI for Node
[23:42] AbyCodes has joined the channel
[23:42] Aria: NuckingFuts: Yeah, but it's request/load/response, not model/view/controller. 
[23:42] NuckingFuts: I hear Ruby even has its own
[23:42] aurynn: Node bindings for ObjC!
[23:42] Aria: Ruby has GTK and TK and Qt and Cocoa bindings.
[23:43] James_tKirk: So a server side way to meta-script UI components. Yes that would be new and probably a good thing. 
[23:43] Aria: Well, that's an option.
[23:43] NuckingFuts: Aria: I'd like to see a UI library that would abstract those for me.
[23:43] Aria: But nobody said 'server' ;-)
[23:43] NuckingFuts: I'd like a native UI for all OSes.
[23:43] James_tKirk: Zend Framework did this for Dojo. Of course the end result was Dojo so it was sad - but it defiantely could be done. 
[23:43] James_tKirk: I woudl actively contribute. 
[23:43] Aria: NuckingFuts: the only problem with that is that you have write once, native nowhere!
[23:44] Aria: (I personally think that UIs should be integrated on each platform.)
[23:44] NuckingFuts: Aria: Nah, you abstract in JS :P
[23:44] NuckingFuts: Or allow native tweaks
[23:44] NuckingFuts: It's up to the coder
[23:44] Aria: Hehe. Abstract UIs are terrible. 
[23:44] Aria: I've used bunches and they all suck.
[23:44] James_tKirk: You can use jQuery intelligently to get around most Browser/platform issues. 
[23:44] NuckingFuts: Just an abstracted thing would be nice to have, at least.
[23:44] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: Once again, not talking about the browser ;)
[23:44] Aria: Yeah. It's an okay place to start. But terrible to use for polish.
[23:45] Aria: Since it's ALL about doing things the way people on each platform expect them.
[23:45] James_tKirk: So you are talking about application development ?
[23:45] NuckingFuts: Aria: agreed.  I think a structure/style/action division is better tho
[23:45] severla has joined the channel
[23:45] NuckingFuts: Like with XUL, CSS can be used to adjust things per OS
[23:45] severla: Hi, I've got a net.Server up, what do I use to connect to it within Node?
[23:46] James_tKirk: through rest.
[23:46] Aria: Assuming that they're not behaviors per OS ;-)
[23:46] James_tKirk: use REST to connect to your Ubuntu native Node app. 
[23:46] Aria: Things like dbus, mach ports, NSURL use ... 
[23:47] Aria: Bundle identifiers on the mac, system tray integration in Windows...
[23:47] hassox has joined the channel
[23:47] saikat has joined the channel
[23:47] NuckingFuts: Aria: Well, tray integration is actually almost universal now lol
[23:47] stalled has joined the channel
[23:47] NuckingFuts: Since you can put the icons up top by the clock in Mac OS X, and Ubuntu has similar too
[23:47] James_tKirk: Please don't flame but - if you can figure out how to write a scripting language that forks between cocoa and .NET you would have most significant platforms solved. 
[23:47] Aria:     Yeah, but they're all different.
[23:48] Aria: And you don't /do/ that on the mac. Those aren't notifications.
[23:48] James_tKirk: You can also write Flash apps that compile on both platforms. 
[23:48] James_tKirk: or Flex. 
[23:48] NuckingFuts: And I think all 3 OSes have things like Growl/Bubble Notifications/Alerts
[23:48] Aria: Yep. And they all work differently. And should work differently.
[23:49] NuckingFuts: I've seen them on Windows (the bubbles), I know Ubuntu has them, and I know Mac OS has alrts too
[23:49] NuckingFuts: Aria: But why?
[23:49] Aria: Because platforms aren't the same. People expect different behaviors.
[23:49] NuckingFuts: They're essentially the same.  You could style them differently, changing the icon, and you could adjust the text a bit (if needed)
[23:49] Aria: On the mac, people expect Growl -- and not just an emulation of it. On Ubuntu, it should throw up an icon WHEN there's a notification and not otherwise. Windows expects an icon ~always, but to toggle a notification state.
[23:49] NuckingFuts: But they're still really the same basic things.
[23:50] Aria: Growl will send notices to other machines, send email, trigger apple events...
[23:50] James_tKirk: Yes - but you have then to fork your implementation to only include common features
[23:50] NuckingFuts: Aria: I'm referring to the Ubuntu block boxes at the top right
[23:50] James_tKirk: which gives you a very shallow toolset. 
[23:50] marcello3d: people don't expect growl, they expect bouncing icons
[23:50] Aria: James_tKirk: And that's the proble.
[23:50] Aria: marcello3d: And that too -- for other notifications.
[23:50] marcello3d: growl is for slightly more advanced users ;)
[23:50] marcello3d: people who would use adium instead of ichat, for example
[23:50] NuckingFuts: Flashing window = bouncing icon
[23:50] NuckingFuts: Amirite?
[23:51] James_tKirk: There is a reason that people like writing apps on the browser - you don't have to fork for all OS's - you just have to fork for Browsers. Which is a bitch - but less of a bitch than native apps. 
[23:51] Aria: Different specifics.
[23:51] Aria: James_tKirk: Yep. But this is also why people dislike using those apps.
[23:51] James_tKirk: Which is a sorry statement about the state of modern computing but there it is. 
[23:51] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: Aye.  But Firefox has managed to do well :P
[23:51] NuckingFuts: Hence why I think the Web-style 3-fold division is the best.
[23:52] James_tKirk: Sure. I don't know about you but I'm not going to my investors and saying, "Your six million has went towards a single browser app. IE users can go screw."
[23:52] marcello3d: james: and you have to fork for ios/android/etc
[23:52] Aria: Hehe. And why I think you can share business logic among versions of an app, but it takes integration with each platform.
[23:52] James_tKirk: That is one reasons why embedded apps like unity are actually a good thing.
[23:53] James_tKirk: I can write a Unity engine app and get the same performance across several mobile platforms, and the web. And the iPad. 
[23:53] NuckingFuts: I stand by it that a universal XUL-esque thing would be nice.
[23:53] James_tKirk: Platform factionalization is an ugly bitch. 
[23:53] James_tKirk: Yes - it would be good - but it is only good if your application is pretty pedestrian in its graphic feature set. 
[23:54] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: CSS is fine
[23:54] James_tKirk: And if that is true - you really might as well build a browser app. 
[23:54] NuckingFuts: You can do some badass things using only HTML + CSS
[23:54] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: No, there's a difference.
[23:54] James_tKirk: I thought you DIDN'T want to build a browser app?
[23:54] NuckingFuts: Or we could make our own format.
[23:54] James_tKirk: or are you using HTML + CSS in a custom browser?
[23:55] James_tKirk: so - use web standards , but not web browsers
[23:55] NuckingFuts: I just think the 3-fold division would be nice for a native app too :P
[23:55] zlipp has joined the channel
[23:55] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: wat?  Ever heard of the Gecko engine?  Yeah, pretty famous thing.
[23:55] marcello3d: what's 3 fold division?
[23:55] NuckingFuts: marcello3d: HTML/CSS/JS
[23:55] James_tKirk: rather, build an app engine that compiles apps on several different native engines (.NET, Cocoa, et all) 
[23:55] marcello3d: sounds like air :)
[23:56] marcello3d: or titanium
[23:56] NuckingFuts: HTML deals with content, CSS deals with how it looks, and then JS is how it does stuff
[23:56] marcello3d: there are a lot of projects like that
[23:56] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: But that's not NodeJS
[23:56] marcello3d: https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless
[23:56] James_tKirk: well - not unless you embed Node into a self contained app engine on each platform
[23:56] LadyGaga: JS can be content too!
[23:56] James_tKirk: and that is not that tough to envision,. 
[23:57] LadyGaga: I used to make entire web sites in Javascript :)
[23:57] James_tKirk: Think about replacing Java with Node
[23:57] marcello3d: html is lousy for layout
[23:57] marcello3d: you probably want a separate template language
[23:57] NuckingFuts: marcello3d: Well, yeah it's not designed for layout lol
[23:57] NuckingFuts: It's designed for content
[23:57] James_tKirk: If you had a budled webkit/node platform that worked on multiple systems you could have some fun. 
[23:57] NuckingFuts: CSS does the layout
[23:57] marcello3d: css is lousy for layout, too
[23:57] marcello3d: css is great for styling things

[23:58] NuckingFuts: CSS can layout things very simply for layout
[23:58] James_tKirk: However - I have to say - I think you'd be better off just writing for Chrome. Unless you had heavy backing. 
[23:58] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: wat
[23:58] NuckingFuts: You're making absolutely no sense.
[23:58] James_tKirk: Possibly.

[23:58] marcello3d: you could use that
[23:58] James_tKirk: A cross platform UI lib. 
[23:59] NuckingFuts: James_tKirk: Exactly.

[23:59] NuckingFuts: For NODE!
[23:59] marcello3d: NuckingFuts: make one =P
[23:59] LadyGaga: Why?
[23:59] James_tKirk: or rather, IN node?
[23:59] marcello3d: obviously none of us feel the need for such a thing, so you're going to have to pioneer it yourself
