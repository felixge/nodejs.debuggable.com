[07:37] bemson: I have some questions about publishing a module that has plugins?
[07:38] bemson: I have the platform code, then packages that extend them, then a default package that _should_ be used with the platform
[07:39] bemson: My library is called Flow, should I publish Flow-platform and Flow-core packages?
[07:39] bemson: In other words, should I publish an npm module for each package that extends this platform?

[07:46] bemson: Marak: I'm beginning to understand thatâ€¦
[07:46] Marak: bemson: the best reason would be external deps. if its just all JS code with shared deps, there is little point
[07:47] zilch_: I am getting the only specific ip address in my logs for the service I am running on EC2

[07:47] zilch_: The IP is 10.170.15.235 always
[07:47] Marak: since it requires a mongodb driver
[07:47] bemson: Marak: I'm confused about exporting things, like the namespace a plugin augments - would each plugin use exports to export the namespace it augments?
[07:48] Marak: bemson: then you should use https://github.com/flatiron/broadway
[07:48] bemson: Marak: thx, taking a look
[07:48] Marak: super lightweight plugin system
[07:49] gripir: hi, does anyone know how to install mongodb for windows? (npm install mongodb doesnt work till now)

[09:56] mYkon: NODE_PATH is set to c:\nodejs
[09:56] ryah: mYkon: require doesn't work globally
[09:56] mYkon: why it works for express module?
[09:56] ryah: mYkon: oh - set NODE_PATH to C:\nodejs\node_modules
[09:56] ryah: i think that should work
[09:56] mYkon: ok
[09:56] mYkon: mom
[09:56] mYkon: no whait
[09:57] mYkon: NODE_PATH has to point to the node.exe folder i think

[10:39] alessioalex: I can help
[10:39] TeddyMurray: awesome :D
[10:39] alessioalex: so, here are the steps:
[10:39] alessioalex: 1) Download the Node msi and install node 
[10:40] alessioalex: 2) Download npm's alpha 2 from here: http://npmjs.org/dist/ and extract everything into C:\Program Files\nodejs (I think, the node.js folder, same level with node.exe)
[10:40] mYkon_ has joined the channel
[10:40] alessioalex: 3) Go into that folder from the command line and type the following 2 commands:
[10:40] alessioalex: set path=%PATH%;%CD%
[10:40] alessioalex: setx path "%PATH%"
[10:40] alessioalex: also I think you should probably have Git installed too
[10:41] alessioalex: if you don't
[10:41] ryah: that sounds like a lot of steps
[10:41] alessioalex: after that, you have node and npm available on you cmdline everywhere
[10:41] alessioalex: hey @ryah 
[10:41] elliotdenk: Hi, anyone using node on FreeBSD? Why is "node" on ports still V0.4.12 even if there is this updating note from 2011-03-18 that "www/node" and "www/node-devel" were merged into "www/node"? ("www/node-devel" is V0.6.2)

[10:43] alessioalex: I actually got Express and Socket.io working
[10:43] TeddyMurray: cool, what do you use nodejs for?
[10:43] TeddyMurray: i want to write a browser chat room using websocket in html5
[10:43] alessioalex: you can use Node for a lot of things

[10:49] alessioalex: shinuza: I think node-redis
[10:49] alessioalex: the one that's used by Socket.IO and express-redis
[10:50] jacobrask: I do some I/O in an object constructor, is it weird to instantiate a new object with MyObject(name, callback) and callback is called from without the constructor with callback(err, new this) ?
[10:51] jacobrask: s/without/within/
[10:51] shinuza: whitman: I think you need to print a \r char
[10:51] shinuza: alessioalex: /me looks at express-redis
[10:52] shinuza: alessioalex: you meant connect-redis?
[10:52] alessioalex: yes sorry
[10:52] alessioalex: connect-redis, for session management
[10:53] tonymilne: jacobrask you could do that or emit something when the object you constructed is ready for use.

[10:55] markwubben has joined the channel
[10:58] jacobrask: ok, I mostly use callbacks in the rest of my code rather than events, so for consistency a callback makes the most sense. it's also important that any actions happen in a known order

However, since node.js does not do multithreading, currently my only alternative would be using child processes, which would be expensive if many simultaneous requests are made. Are there any plans to include multithreading support in node.js anytime soon?

[13:57] malkomalko has joined the channel
[13:57] shapeshed: other projects are actually moving core libraries out to packages out to allow faster releases and agility

[13:59] AaronMT has joined the channel
[13:59] shapeshed: sounds like a feature / issue that would make sense

[14:01] shapeshed: :-)
[14:01] mmalecki: shapeshed: rt'ed, btw
[14:02] remysharp: shapeshed: so is it that npm gets installed automatically then?

[14:04] c4milo has joined the channel
[14:04] shapeshed: but it seems an odd call to me to ship it with the core at all
[14:05] remysharp: shapeshed: thing is - or that I've found - npm needed to be reinstalled to latest when I upgraded node
[14:05] shapeshed: that's true
[14:05] remysharp: playing devil's advocate - it ensures the two are n'sync - bye bye by--- sorry, yeah, in sync.

[14:07] shapeshed: accept that there are issues between npm and node versions
[14:07] shapeshed: my beef is more architectural
[14:07] remysharp: if npm is to ruby what gems are -- seems to be okay - or certainly a core tool you'd want with node
[14:08] shapeshed: I guess I'm more of the opinion that small tools that you pull together are better than one big monolithic one
[14:08] mmalecki: but you still can use node without npm
[14:08] mmalecki: shapeshed++
[14:08] catb0t: shapeshed now has 1 beer
[14:09] remysharp: I agree - on both counts, but adding npm doesn't equate monolithic - or yet it doesn't! :)
[14:09] remysharp: but yeah, is it a slippery slope?
[14:10] shapeshed: for me yes
[14:10] shapeshed: npm is a great project but work in progress, especially for windows support
[14:10] shapeshed: it is going to mean a new node release is triggered for each npm release
[14:11] shapeshed: this is slower all round
[14:11] wereHamster: shapeshed: I agree with you, don't think adding npm to node was a good decision :-/

[14:13] booyaa: unless of cause npm starts to ship prebuilt mods
[14:14] remysharp: I don't agree - compiling code manually is one thing - writing JS on the server is a very different thing

[14:31] remysharp: I put npm back in by doing `make install` on the 0.6.3 directory - and it just put npm back
[14:31] tanepiper: oh hey remy, long time no see
[14:32] remysharp: tanepiper: the money I paid for Harry's invisibility cloak paid off then.

[14:49] hipsterslapfight: all my apps i write have to call a java backend
[14:49] diogogmt has joined the channel
[14:50] remysharp: ahh, java. all those setters, and getters, and spagetti - oo - lunch!
[14:50] shapeshed: all busy or just crap?
[14:50] hipsterslapfight: speaking of which, anybody in the UK looking for a well-paid senior java developer job? :v
[14:50] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: reviewing... keep in mind that it can't land in v0.6 (but it can in master)
[14:50] remysharp: crap
[14:50] deedubs: an experienced dev should be able to pick up node pretty quickly.  It's not rails and there isn't 100,000 lines of 'magic' behind the scenes of every node.js app
[14:50] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: I'll allow it.
[14:50] remysharp: shapeshed: your guys were the only people actually recommended.
[14:50] bnoordhuis: hipsterslapfight: define 'well-paid'
[14:50] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: well, i'm glad you do :)
[14:50] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: ;)
[14:50] nebiros: hipsterslapfight: I work like 2 years just with java, struts ans jsf all the day :'(
[14:50] hipsterslapfight: bnoordhuis: i think it's around Â£40-50k, so not 'badly-paid' :v
[14:51] hipsterslapfight: you may have to move to scotland though ...

[14:51] mmalecki: I laught when I see someone working with PHP.
[14:51] mmalecki: I shouldn't, probably
[14:52] hipsterslapfight: i have to go back to php next week to start some maintenance on an older project
[14:52] hipsterslapfight: not looking forward to it after spending the last 2 months in node-land

[17:42] Roman__: Hello guys! I've started with nodejs yesterday and there's something I couldn't find in the docs or on google. I have:
[17:42] Roman__: var area = 0;
[17:42] Roman__: socket.on('areachange', function(data) {
[17:42] TheJH: http://i.imgur.com/3drwp.png
[17:42] Roman__: 		removeSocketFromArea.bind(this)();

[17:42] Roman__: ... and a function in global scope ....
[17:42] Roman__: function removeSocketFromArea() {
[17:42] Roman__: 	if (area != 0) {
[17:42] Roman__:                ...
[17:42] TheJH: Roman__, stop
[17:42] Roman__:         }
[17:42] Roman__: }
[17:42] Roman__: Since V8 provides bind(), why do I get a "area is not defined" in the rebound function?
[17:42] koo3 has joined the channel
[17:43] TheJH: Roman__, because "this" inside of the callback is nothing usable
[17:43] TheJH: Roman__, it's the global context
[17:44] Roman__: hmm oO ah
[17:44] Roman__: how could I solve my problem then

[17:45] Roman__: why? I have an anonymous function which provides data. I want to execute the "removeSocketFromArea" in the scope I have within this anonymous function. Is that wrong?

[17:47] Roman__: "area" is within an unreachable scope for "removeSocketFromArea" if it isn't bound. I could reference all the vars I use as parameters, but I didn't really want to do that... The goal is to have access with this function to these "inner" variables, like "area".

[17:57] Roman__: help definitely appreciated... (may also be a reference where I should look, since I wasn't successful with google...)
[17:57] Roman__: yes
[17:57] Roman__: should be
[17:57] seebees: why not:
[17:57] Roman__: that's why I bind
[17:57] Roman__: why what not?
[17:57] Roman__: why it's not bound? I don't know
[17:57] seebees: removeSocketFromArea.call(this, data)?
[17:57] Roman__: that works?
[17:57] Roman__: ok I'll try
[17:58] seebees: Roman__ it would pass data to removeSocketFromArea and run in the socket context.

[18:10] Roman__: data? data isn't needed
[18:11] Roman__: "this" should be enough, since "area" is not part of "data"
[18:12] Roman__: What I wanted is that the function could directly access area. The correction you made is adding a parameter.

[18:15] Roman__: this. area is now a copy of area, since it's an integer, right?

[21:19] itayneeman: Anyone here?
[21:19] mmalecki: itayneeman: sup?
[21:20] itayneeman: I'm wondering regarding some odd behavior I'm seeing in 0.6
[21:20] itayneeman: on OS X
[21:20] itayneeman: if I do var stdin = process.stdin
[21:20] itayneeman: then the process exit handler never gets called
[21:20] itayneeman: and the process never exits
[21:20] mmalecki: itayneeman: it's a known bug
[21:20] itayneeman: good to know
[21:20] itayneeman: is there a bug number?
[21:21] mmalecki: no, there was mine pull request which had a test
[21:21] mmalecki: look for self-termination (search it)
[21:21] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: Never gonna let you down
[21:22] itayneeman: yeah, I saw some issues referencing it
[21:22] itayneeman: Do you have any idea if it plans to be fixed?
[21:22] mmalecki: (I'll just slowly keep rickrolling him until he gets to my pull request)
[21:22] mmalecki: itayneeman: I'd say, bug bnoordhuis.
[21:22] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: hey, when are you going to fix this stdin issue?
[21:23] mmalecki: itayneeman: like that ^
[21:23] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: actually, piscisaureus voiced some concerns about it being inconsistent with other APIs (probably net.Server)
[21:23] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: which one? tls or stdin?
[21:23] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: I'm running into it when I make a clone of the process object for vm.runInNewContext purposes
[21:23] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: tls
[21:24] bnoordhuis: itayneeman: yes, known bug
[21:24] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: ok, feel free to close it/elaborate. I can fix it.
[21:24] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: is there any suggested workaround?
[21:24] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[21:24] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: i'll let you bug piscisaureus about it now :)
[21:25] bnoordhuis: itayneeman: no
[21:25] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: you're a sneaky bastard, my fine sir.
[21:25] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: unfortunate :)
[21:26] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: heeeey :D
[21:26] bnoordhuis: itayneeman: we'll fix it some day, it's kind of tricky to get right without breaking other things
[21:26] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: any ideas what the timeline for a fix is? Just want to know when I should be on the lookout :)
[21:26] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: I see.
[21:26] itayneeman: well, that definitely puts a wrinkle in things :)
[21:27] bnoordhuis: itayneeman: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2175 <- this is tangentially related btw, the fix for that issue potentially may also fix what you're seeing
[21:29] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: OK. But there is no ETA, and right now, automatic exit won't happen if somebody happens to use process.stdin.
[21:29] itayneeman: bnoordhuis: and there is no way for me to manually invoke it, since I don't nkow when everything is done (no more queued events)
[21:30] bnoordhuis: itayneeman: that is correct

[21:34] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: awesome. something more specific?
[21:34] mmalecki: I don't understand how unreferencing stdin could break tests.
[21:34] mmalecki: if it does, tests are bad.
[21:35] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: maybe, but someone needs to review the affected tests

[21:42] GrizzLyCRO has joined the channel
[21:43] EuroNerd: I'm new to node.js, so I have a silly question:  Does node.js run only in response to client requests, or can it be made to run some code continuously by itself? 
[21:44] pksunkara: EuroNerd: It can run by itself
[21:44] maxogden: EuroNerd: yes and yes
[21:44] EuroNerd: But like really continuously, without some CRON trickery?
[21:45] maxogden: EuroNerd: node is one global event loop. its really good at idling
[21:46] maxogden: EuroNerd: ive had a node server running for months listening to a remote couchdb using https://github.com/iriscouch/follow
[21:46] EuroNerd: Well, I was aiming for more than idling. Specifically, I'm thinking of a not-so-massive MMORPG server. ;)  So I'd like the game world to keep running (bots wandering around and stuff) regardless of whether any players are connected.

[21:51] N0va` has joined the channel
[21:51] EuroNerd: One last question:  Since node.js is an interpreted language, and assuming my little game server one day grows too heavy... (Which is easy to imagine - just build a big world and let tons of AI characters wander around and you don't need any players at all to kill it. ;)) ...Well, in that situation, what would you recommend for writing the next gen server?
[21:51] EuroNerd: [Lotsa pie in the sky here, I know ;)]
[21:51] maxogden: first gen: write in node
[21:51] maxogden: second gen: rewrite 4 more times in node
[21:52] maxogden: if you do it right you wont just have one little game server
[21:52] maxogden: but a scalable cluster of game servers
[21:52] EuroNerd: Yeah, probably asking on a node.js channel "what should I replace node.js with" is not a good idea. ;)

[22:00] GrizzLyCRO: why you all talkative,  what is easy framework to start with?
[22:00] GrizzLyCRO: [are all...]
[22:01] deedubs: express?
[22:01] GrizzLyCRO: from what i can see around the web, express is popular, and i intend to play with socket.io and mongodb
[22:01] deedubs: depends on what kind of framework
[22:01] deedubs: express, socket.io, mongoose, 
[22:01] GrizzLyCRO: ok, thanks that is what i had in mind
[22:01] GrizzLyCRO: i only thought to use nowjs
[22:01] deedubs: no
[22:01] deedubs: learn socket.io
[22:02] GrizzLyCRO: i will use socket.io, but can you elaborate
[22:02] deedubs: better to learn on the ground level
[22:02] bradleyg has joined the channel
[22:03] GrizzLyCRO: is relationship between socket.io vs nowjs something like IE6 AJAX vs jquery ajax?
[22:03] siculars has joined the channel
[22:03] deedubs: nowjs uses socket.io
[22:04] GrizzLyCRO: i know
[22:04] GrizzLyCRO: i just dont know how much it simplifies it
[22:04] GrizzLyCRO: for example, some really long time ago, i wrote different ajax functions for each browser
[22:04] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[22:04] GrizzLyCRO: and recently started web dev, and was surprised how easy is to make ajax call with jquery
[22:05] deedubs: socket.io gives you a standard api to web sockets across all browsers
[22:05] deedubs: including those that do not natively support them
[22:05] deedubs: nowjs leverages that to make 2-way RPC easier
[22:05] GrizzLyCRO: ah nvm, from what i can see socket.io is simple enough to use
