[00:00] jaequery: anyone know any good alternative to something like chef?
[00:00] Aria: puppet?
[00:00] shimondoodkin: chef supposed to be good
[00:00] Aria: chef is awful "code OS dependencies yourself, have fun with that"
[00:00] jaequery: i just don't do ruby =(
[00:00] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: i find the examples extremely helpful, not just with express specifically, but for overall node style.
[00:01] Aria: Smart person.
[00:01] jaequery: i do php!
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: quackslike: totally, i keep forgetting to add a socket.io example
[00:01] jaequery: am i still smart? :O

[00:02] quackslike: i've been wondering, what would be a nice way to build a gui app with node as the workhorse, what gui libraries would be a good fit?
[00:02] shimondoodkin: it takes like two days to get to know ruby. i personaly like node js more, then ruby and php.
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: quackslike: for that stuff what I want
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: is
[00:03] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: that would be nice. i dont know much about socket.io at all.. i've been playing with nowjs
[00:03] linnk: quackslike: I think someone is doing gtk bindings for node
[00:03] slickplaid: nowjs uses socket.io, doesn't it?
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: basically a window running webkit (WebView or w/e) that starts up your node app behind the scenes
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: so that it runs like a regular app
[00:03] shimondoodkin: and there was some 3d svg gui
[00:03] dingomanatee has left the channel
[00:03] darshanshankar: slickplaid: yep
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: but is 100% js / html blah blah
[00:03] jaequery: nowjs? what's that
[00:03] quackslike: slickplaid: i think so, but you dont have to do anything with socketio your self afaik
[00:04] slickplaid: right :)
[00:04] Marak: SubStack: represent: http://thechangelog.com/
[00:04] slickplaid: but you're still using it :D
[00:04] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: that's a nice idea.
[00:04] darshanshankar: jaequery: http://nowjs.com -- shared state between client and server, like RPC
[00:04] darshanshankar: jaequery: synced under "now" namespace, with groups, individual client addressing and other features

[00:08] tjholowaychuk: tim doesnt know c++ tho so i dunno about that haha
[00:08] danfo: just looked at it on the top of http://pinboard.in/t:node.js is all. haha
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: might be similar
[00:09] danfo: I'm totally star struck btw - expressjs rocks

[00:10] tjholowaychuk: he does mention using webview so that might be really similar

[00:14] sechrist: I am failing to see the importance of it, let alone the importance of them having a real company founded behind this idea
[00:14] mikey_p: i guess uber are using it
[00:14] wafflesburger: to get seed money probably
[00:15] wafflesburger: from clueless investors
[00:15] sechrist: exactly
[00:15] darshanshankar: ahem
[00:15] sechrist: it's kind of infuriating
[00:15] darshanshankar: i wouldn't make accusations like that
[00:15] darshanshankar: without backing that up
[00:15] darshanshankar: you're quite literally trolling
[00:15] wafflesburger: it's the internet, since when do we have to back up claims? :P
[00:15] sjbreen: I believe it's a nicer warpper around socket.io
[00:15] darshanshankar: without know the business behind nowjs
[00:15] sechrist: there better be a platform, some nice debugging tools, or something
[00:15] jhurliman: you can never have too many abstraction layers on top of rpc
[00:16] mikey_p: i'm not that impressed with what i've seen, but i'd rather just ignore it that troll IRC
[00:16] sechrist: they need to provide some value over my homie's projects on github
[00:16] sechrist: for me not to be infuriated
[00:16] darshanshankar: so you have a major bias
[00:16] darshanshankar: and you're trolling
[00:16] darshanshankar: awesome
[00:16] mikey_p: did you personally invest in them?
[00:16] darshanshankar: im a founder
[00:16] wafflesburger: no i don't have a bias
[00:16] darshanshankar: (talking about sechrist )

[00:18] sechrist: yes
[00:18] xeodox: didn't have to deal with ajax or anything else anymore, pheww~
[00:18] sechrist: omg ajax so hard
[00:18] sechrist: if you're using node, there's node-dnode and even socket.io
[00:18] sechrist: which you could build the same thing on top of
[00:19] xeodox: socket.io is a bitch to scale
[00:19] halfhalo: yeah, don't see the point of nowjs myself
[00:19] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[00:19] Marak: i dont see how nowjs is going to make money
[00:19] sechrist: xeodox: it's not "a bitch" to scale, because I've done it
[00:19] darshanshankar: you realize we're building a scalable cluster version to sell to enterprise?
[00:19] Marak: nowjs should have the proxy stuff removed into a seperate module, and built better
[00:19] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[00:19] sechrist: howerver it's all custom
[00:19] Marak: then use something else for the transport
[00:19] Marak: i dunno
[00:19] sechrist: I have socket.io events sharded and shit
[00:19] wafflesburger: does it support horizontal scalilng and sharding
[00:19] sechrist: and clustering is coming soon claims guille I think
[00:20] sechrist: mine is horizontal backed by rabbitmq
[00:20] sechrist: my goal was to get events out of node as soon as possible and into a broker
[00:20] jmoyers: HORIZONTAL?
[00:20] jmoyers: and backed by an MQ
[00:20] sechrist: yes
[00:20] sechrist: of course!
[00:20] jmoyers: jesus i just got buzzed with buzzwords
[00:20] wafflesburger: :D
[00:20] quackslike: this is what's called tall poppy syndrome..
[00:21] sechrist: you're assuming it's a single node message queue
[00:21] Marak: do the nowjs guys even come in here? i dont think ive ever talked to them or know who they are
[00:21] Marak: not community players as far as i know
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: I scale socket.io diagonally
[00:21] quackslike: rip someone down because your're either too stupid to do it yourself, or didnt think of it first..
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: booyah
[00:21] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: lol
[00:21] sechrist: i'm not ripping anybody down, but if it is true that they exploited VCs to get funding by throwing "node node node" around
[00:21] quackslike: nowjs seems good to me
[00:21] sechrist: I'd be sad
[00:21] jhurliman: i'm going to use that in our next pitch. diagonal scalability
[00:21] SubStack: Marak: darshanshankar is in here
[00:21] jmoyers: heh
[00:21] darshanshankar: i didn't realize how nasty this community is

[00:22] jmoyers: nobody's 'exploiting' vc's
[00:22] sechrist: no i'm just nasty
[00:22] darshanshankar: im shocked that im literally getting trolled
[00:22] quackslike: pfft exploited VC's get real
[00:22] jmoyers: vc's exploit

[00:23] Marak: darshanshankar: well maybe you should clarify your goals a little and community might better understand what you are trying to do
[00:24] sechrist: so I can only assume they raised funding for that code
[00:24] jmoyers: raising money and starting a company is hard enough
[00:24] darshanshankar: yeah i realize that
[00:24] darshanshankar: our website tells nothing about the company
[00:24] jacter has joined the channel
[00:24] sechrist: nodejitsu, on the other hand

[00:24] sechrist: who they raised funding from
[00:24] sechrist: who they are
[00:24] sechrist: all kinds of shit
[00:24] quackslike: Marak: why does he need to get the community to understand what they're doing?
[00:24] darshanshankar: Marak: we license the technology and support it on an enterprise level
[00:24] mikey_p: did anyone notice that the article about nginx with embedded v8, that bashed v8 made it to the top of hacker news the day of nodeconf?
[00:24] SubStack: don't feel sorry for VCs, they have too much money anyhow
[00:25] sechrist: darshanshankar: if your goal is to support nodejs based eventing for enterprise, that's awesome
[00:25] sechrist: but I would have never gleaned that from anything I can find on the internets
[00:25] darshanshankar: like we are focused on enterprise which is a whole different ball game

[00:26] darshanshankar: and while guille and rafael have learnboost (which is also awesome, that industry needs some change)

[00:26] darshanshankar: the type of robustness required at the enterprise level requires a "bit" of capital, hence why i raised money

[00:28] sechrist: now, tell me how easy it is to cluster your nowjs product
[00:28] darshanshankar: LOL
[00:28] sechrist: and load balance
[00:28] darshanshankar: its not
[00:28] darshanshankar: i mean just the load balancer alone
[00:29] darshanshankar: not easy
[00:29] sechrist: I mean you're enterprise
[00:29] wafflesburger: but i thought nodejs scales scemantically out of the box?
[00:29] sechrist: where's my HA and fault tolerance
[00:29] darshanshankar: well the other part you should probably know...
[00:29] Marak: darshanshankar: what im hearing from you makes me think its more of a snake oil salesman scenario, but personally i cant really hate on someone trying to make money and promote node.js. You might have to accept that the community might be a little upset, so you should act accordingly. 
[00:29] halfhalo: its all tied in using an access DB
[00:29] darshanshankar: most of our enterprise code is not on github
[00:29] slickplaid: you guys sound kind of hostile towards him
[00:29] sechrist: ACTION had to make socket.io HA and fault tolerant for an enterprise site
[00:29] sechrist: so i'm genuinely interested
[00:29] sechrist: that makes sense

[00:30] wafflesburger: where do you find the time to learn nodejs?  is everyone self employed?
[00:30] darshanshankar: we haven't decided on BSD or what
[00:30] sechrist: oh snap Marak++
[00:31] Marak: wafflesburger: i spent a year doing nonstop node for no money, pretty much bankrupted me
[00:31] darshanshankar: what does nodejitsu have to do with us...
[00:31] jwl: i want to have a js file on both node.js and browser
[00:31] wafflesburger: what kind of stuff did you build in that time Marak; 
[00:31] sechrist: a cloud
[00:31] darshanshankar: you guys are going down the Node PaaS route, correct Marak?
[00:31] sechrist: he literally built a cloud
[00:31] slickplaid: lots and lots of chats :D
[00:31] jwl: i can't check this.module because node.js throws an error then
[00:31] wafflesburger: woah, now that sounds scalable sechrist; 
[00:31] Marak: wafflesburger: you seen my github? all sorts of crap
[00:32] jwl: it says this.module isnt defined
[00:32] wafflesburger: no i just read about nodejs yesterday actually
[00:32] Marak: darshanshankar: we are doing PaAS => ASP and everything in between, its a large space
[00:32] wafflesburger: and made a blog thingy with only posting ability
[00:32] jwl: how can i check the environment (browser or node) without either the browser or node throwing an error about undefined variables=
[00:32] sorens3n: waffle: i spent every spare moment i had learning node while employed, now that i'm not, its all day every day
[00:33] Marak: darshanshankar: making scalable fault tolerant node.js web applications is the core of our business
[00:33] darshanshankar: Marak: thats cool - but we have a different challenge with the shared now namespace
[00:33] darshanshankar: we're not in the PaaS market
[00:33] Marak: darshanshankar: sure
[00:34] pyrotechnick: i think you guys need to test nowjs before we start taking you seriouslyt
[00:34] Marak: darshanshankar: if you dont mind me asking, how is hiring going? you finding good node people?
[00:34] darshanshankar: ya man, it just takes time to do everything
[00:34] pyrotechnick: you know what takes more time than writing tests?
[00:34] sorens3n: i would definately suggest dnode over now.js
[00:34] darshanshankar: Marak: still searching, we're focused more on good dist sys guys

[00:56] wafflesburger: virginia beach / norfolk

[00:57] tim_smart: wafflesburger: You want a job in something you haven't used?
[00:57] Marak: darshanshankar: maybe use dnode as the transport for nowjs, i dont know. i havent looked too deep into your codebase
[00:57] wafflesburger: no i'm not talking about node jobs xD

[01:20] ChrisPartridge: SubStack: Trying to wrap up a piece of dnode middleware nicely, and I have a module.middleware(config) which returns the dnode middleware, but i also have module.client() which contains a preconfigured dnode client for the browser.. the question is - can I browserify a single export from a module?

[01:21] SubStack: hmmm I should probably expose the browserify options so you can do crazy stuff like that
[01:21] Aria: Wow, no CIA. Crazy talk.
[01:22] halfhalo: time to make our own!
[01:22] SubStack: ChrisPartridge: you can always just browserify({ require : [ 'dnode', 'dnode-yourmiddlewarething' ] }) in the meanwhile

[01:24] ChrisPartridge: or am I not making any sense?
[01:24] SubStack: ChrisPartridge: you can have browser-specific code for packages in browserify, just set the browserify field in the package.json
[01:24] SubStack: sounds like that's what you want?
[01:24] SubStack: that's what dnode does so you can require('dnode') browser-side
[01:24] ChrisPartridge: SubStack: haha, that easy huh... 
[01:24] ChrisPartridge: awesome
[01:25] SubStack: yeah check out the dnode package.json for an example

[01:26] SubStack: people have been some highly excellent add-ons for my modules lately, I like this
[01:26] ChrisPartridge: SubStack; I would have done it sooner, but I never realised dnode was bidirectional
[01:26] ChrisPartridge: makes things so much easier
[01:27] SubStack: bidirectional and symmetric and everything!

[01:27] sorens3n: that reminds me, i still need to release the latest dnode add-on i've made for backbone :(
[01:27] SubStack: except drb is synchronous and tries to serialize using yaml or some bullshit
[01:27] SubStack: but otherwise is a great idea
[01:27] Aria: True that. Ruby marshal, actually.
[01:27] SubStack: oh that's the thing
[01:28] Aria: And it makes sense if you're not gonna go async
[01:28] Aria: But async kicks its ass.
[01:28] SubStack: it super sucks if your server is blocking while other requests are coming inbound
[01:28] ChrisPartridge: ew yaml
[01:28] SubStack: have to build your own threadpool
[01:28] SubStack: which is super lame

[01:38] sorens3n: i would say definately so
[01:38] ChrisPartridge: SubStack: in my module i'm browserifying, if I require('dnode'), i then only need to tell browserify to get my module right? (and it will recursively include dnode?)

[01:53] softdrink: Call it O_o
[01:55] aconbere has joined the channel

[02:05] superphly has joined the channel
[02:05] superphly: Hey guys, not sure if this is the right channel to be asking this question, but I'm having some issues with an application written in node.js I believe
[02:05] softdrink: I'm sure it would be ok with a real keyboard though
[02:06] ryah: superphly: ask away
[02:06] superphly: I'm running TileMill and just got done compiling it and what not... I run the tilemill.js and the server starts and waits for a connection... all is good at that point
[02:06] superphly: once I connect from the browser it loads the interface then loses connection because the server crashes with this error:
[02:07] superphly: fs:282
[02:07] superphly:   binding.mkdir(path, mode, callback || noop);
[02:07] superphly: not sure if that's a binding for node.js, which is why i'm a bit confused as to where i'm supposed to be asking
[02:09] jwl: SubStack: what is the main difference between browserify and now.js?
[02:09] ryah: superphly: fs is a node module
[02:09] ji0n has joined the channel
[02:10] superphly: what's the best way to go about getting that installed, it should have come with the pull i'm guessing
[02:10] ryah: superphly: hard to say... maybe you don't have permissions to mkdir?is that all it says?
[02:10] SubStack: jwl: browserify is a browser-side require() thing
[02:11] superphly: http://pastebin.com/X0UWTf6s
[02:11] jwl: it sends the js to the browser
[02:11] SubStack: now.js is an rpc module, completely different
[02:11] jwl: you cant run the code in the server right?
[02:11] jwl: okay
[02:11] SubStack: browserify bundles up your source into a single file so you can require() stuff like you can do in plain-old node.js
[02:12] SubStack: which is actually a useful thing to do just not in the ways you might expect
[02:12] superphly: ryah: http://pastebin.com/X0UWTf6s
[02:12] sjbreen: browserify == node bundler??

[02:19] jesusabdullah: I would be interested in using ender in concert with browserify
[02:19] guybrush: besides https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[02:19] jesusabdullah: such that you can use browserify ender's submodules
[02:19] guybrush: right thats a good idea actually
[02:20] guybrush: but maybe it would be better to provide browserify with a cli
[02:20] jesusabdullah: hence https://github.com/ender-js/Ender/issues/27
[02:20] jesusabdullah: Either one!
[02:20] jesusabdullah: Actually, both

[02:30] jesusabdullah: It just bundles up libraries for you
[02:30] jesusabdullah: You could do all that yourself
[02:30] jesusabdullah: but it's a tool for that, basically
[02:30] jesusabdullah: with "blessed" libs and a unifying api
[02:30] kmiyashiro: I wish people wouldn't use $
[02:31] kmiyashiro: can you specify a different namespace?
[02:31] jesusabdullah: the thing is that they're small libraries that only do one thing, so you can bundle, basically, a customized version of this one library for every project, depending on what you need and don't need
[02:31] jesusabdullah: Cool idea
[02:31] jesusabdullah: kmiyashiro: I think so? i haven't actually used it, just read about it
[02:31] SubStack: kmiyashiro: you can with browserify!
[02:31] SubStack: var $ = require('jquery-browserify')
[02:32] SubStack: or var moo or whatevs
[02:32] jesusabdullah: for example
[02:32] kmiyashiro: I thought ender was a frontend thing
[02:32] SubStack: it's pretty boss
[02:32] jesusabdullah: It is
[02:32] strmpnk has joined the channel
[02:32] kmiyashiro: what is browserify?
[02:32] kmiyashiro: who is it and what does he do?
[02:32] jesusabdullah: browserify is a thing that bundles npm repos for client-side
[02:33] jesusabdullah: includes some basic events and a require()
[02:33] kmiyashiro: bwhaat?
[02:33] SubStack: not just npm repos but also directories
[02:33] SubStack: so you can write your browser code just like you write node code
[02:33] SuperPhly: having some errors with node.js and the fs module. It's reporting that   binding.mkdir(path, mode, callback || noop); has a bad argument
[02:33] jesusabdullah: kmiyashiro: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[02:34] jesusabdullah: kmiyashiro: also, http://ender.no.de
[02:34] SuperPhly: Anyone here care to help me identify why this might be happening? http://pastebin.com/X0UWTf6s
[02:34] jesusabdullah: I actually think it'd be nice to combine ender.no.de with browserify
[02:34] SuperPhly: do i need to upgrade a library or two on my system to get that object.mkdir call to work?
[02:35] kmiyashiro: why would you use stuff from npm in the browser?
[02:35] jesusabdullah: SuperPhly: Looks like one of your args isn't what you think it is
[02:35] jesusabdullah: kmiyashiro: some of it is relatively general-purpose, and it's nice to have ssjs and csjs act similarly
[02:35] SubStack: kmiyashiro: npm is a nice way to distribute modules
[02:35] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[02:35] SubStack: there are nice flow control libs on there too
[02:35] SubStack: and data transformation libs that you might want to use browser-side
[02:35] amerine has joined the channel
[02:36] kmiyashiro: such as?
[02:36] SubStack: or template engines and fun stuff like that

[02:36] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[02:36] SubStack: like half of my modules actually
[02:36] SubStack: plus stuff like jquery-browserify

[04:19] eyez: hah

[04:21] fson has joined the channel
[04:21] eyez: but he asks what you want to have happen
[04:22] abraxas: I just want to abort the flow.
[04:23] abraxas: Exceptions are a bit aggressive, or I'd have to try/catch my flow every time... Not a huge problem, but I'd like to know if there are alternatives.
[04:23] abraxas: If he doesn't use flow anymore, may I ask why?
[04:23] eyez: "he can always just keep track of his first callback and then call that. there's no reason that you must continue execution of the flow"

[04:31] SubStack: abraxas: I wrote one called seq with chainable error handling
[04:31] zackattack has joined the channel
[04:31] SubStack: so you can .catch() exceptions
[04:31] eyez: streamline also just magically makes try/catch work
[04:32] abraxas: eyez: thanks! mrjjwright or willconant?
[04:32] SubStack: .catch() != try/catch
[04:32] eyez: abraxas: willconant
[04:32] abraxas: SubStack: I'll have a look, thanks
[04:32] SubStack: doesn't streamline do source transformation?
[04:32] eyez: yeah i don't like it as a catch-all solution, but its way nice for simple flows
[04:33] SubStack: that makes me uneasy
[04:33] eyez: it basically rewrites non-async style code into async-style
[04:33] eyez: from what i've seen its solid
[04:34] SubStack: and then it monkey punches require() it seems, also makes me uneasy
[04:34] levi501d has joined the channel
[04:35] eyez: yeah i haven't used it for anything serious, but he's been using it in production for a while

[04:50] blueadept: must have not been far behind, this worked about 6 weeks ago, only recently when i deicded to jump ahead did it break

[04:56] tonymilne:   example: function() { },
[04:56] tonymilne: });
[04:57] tonymilne: and they work ok.
[04:57] tonymilne: (So, i create my schema first, describing the collection, then add statics / methods to it, then mongoose.model('example', schema) to create it)
[04:58] blueadept: right, yeah i'm doing the same thing
[04:58] tonymilne: yours might be slightly different, because you are adding to User
[04:58] jmoyers has joined the channel
[04:59] tonymilne: vs, im adding to the schema before User is created. (i think)
[04:59] blueadept: oh i see
[04:59] blueadept: let me try that
[05:00] tonymilne: So if you're inline object your schema, e.g. mongoose.model('User', { ... }) 
[05:00] tonymilne: Try splitting that out to a variable schema first.
[05:00] blueadept: yeah it worked now
[05:00] blueadept: the order was messing it up
[05:00] tonymilne: Awesome.
[05:00] SubStack: gah npm why you gotta recompile my devDependencies like that
[05:00] blueadept: thanks!

[07:14] JackeyChan: hi, again. can I post my code for explain something ?
[07:14] tonymilne: I just checked npm install cluster,
[07:14] tonymilne: and it also installed log@1.1.1
[07:14] nexxy: wtf pastie says you're a time traveler, tonymilne 
[07:14] tonymilne: I know right, Aussies are super bad ass like that!
[07:14] nexxy: Pasted
[07:14] nexxy: 1 minute from now
[07:15] saschagehlich: tonymilne: I don't install stuff via npm for production, always putting them in as submodules
[07:15] nexxy: oh wait
[07:15] nexxy: that makes me the time traveler!
[07:15] saschagehlich: maybe I should start using npm more...
[07:15] nexxy: saschagehlich, yus, you should
[07:15] nexxy: does npm install and compile node.js yet?

[07:16] JackeyChan: I post it :
[07:16] JackeyChan: res.render('index', {
[07:16] JackeyChan: 				  title: 'taxonomy',
[07:16] JackeyChan: 				  taxonomy: results
[07:16] JackeyChan: 	      });
[07:16] JackeyChan: and render:
[07:16] JackeyChan: - for (var vocabulary in #{taxonomy})
[07:16] JackeyChan:     li vocabulary[name]
[07:16] JackeyChan: I don't know what's the wrong with there code, can some guys help me ???
[07:16] saschagehlich: okay, so is there a good way to handle dependencies in production? like creating a package.json, putting dependencies into it and install them via npm?
[07:17] tonymilne: saschagehlich: I've written something that does that using npm.
[07:17] tonymilne: I'm working to get it released.
[07:17] tonymilne: i can postie it too, probs.
[07:17] nexxy: isn't that the point of package.json? or am I missing something
[07:17] mtsl has joined the channel
[07:17] tonymilne: Well, i just have a project, which has 10 dependencies.
[07:18] tonymilne: When it starts up, it checks its got them all (and the right version)
[07:18] saschagehlich: tonymilne: me too... shouldn't npm link install the dependencies?
[07:18] tonymilne: so, when team mates check out my code.
[07:18] emattias has joined the channel
[07:18] nexxy: oh, gotcha
[07:18] tonymilne: they get a working copy, despite version bumps and new dependencies being installed.
[07:18] tonymilne: it's good because version control knows exactly when npm versions of modules were updated.
[07:18] nexxy: isn't it possible to create private npm repos?
[07:19] nexxy: you could just package your project 
[07:19] tonymilne: yeah, i could, but im noob :(
[07:19] nexxy: and have them use npm
[07:19] tonymilne: could anyone install my project then?
[07:19] nexxy: anyone that has access to your private repo
[07:19] nexxy: I don't *know* if npm has that capability yet
[07:19] tonymilne: oh, ya good point.
[07:19] nexxy: but I thought I overheard it mentioned @ nodeconf
[07:20] SubStack: some people have private npm repos already but I have no idea how to set one of those up

[07:22] tlrobinson: for the http server, what happens if a request comes in before you have any "request" event listeners?
[07:22] ryah: ++

[07:22] nexxy: SubStack, talk to max ogden
[07:22] ryah: tlrobinson: it gets rejected
[07:22] ryah: i think
[07:22] mjr_: I haven't tried this, but I assume what you do is replicate the couchdb to some local couchdb
[07:22] nexxy: his couch magic is only rivaled by his magical beard
[07:23] quackslike: JackeyChan: does results contain what you think?
[07:23] mjr_: CouchDb replication is one of the best things about CouchDB.

[07:24] tlrobinson: ryah: how about if you call listen and .on("request"...) in the same tick, or in the listen callback?

[07:27] mjr_: I assume that's exactly what it's like.
[07:27] nexxy: yes.

[07:37] mjr_: But the libev guy doesn't like the patch, so node would have to float it, and that sucks.

[07:48] mjr_: mattpat: if you set a lot of timeouts for the same amount, this is pretty efficient.
[07:49] mattpat: mjr_: Makes sense, but let's say they're all for different amounts. For the sake of argument, let's say I have 5,000 timeouts set, only about a fifth of which end up on duplicated dates.
[07:49] mattpat: It's more intellectual curiosity than "I think I should write a program that does this" :P
[07:49] JackeyChan: hi, I want to add class with var, such as li.item-#{id}. but it can not work. somebody know that ?

[12:37] JacobSingh: guybrush: thanks, dnode is the obvious front-runner due to the graphic on their readme 
[12:37] JacobSingh: but nowjs looks pretty well documented
[12:37] chapel: well dnode is awesome
[12:37] JacobSingh: I guess they both do the same thing...
[12:37] chapel: I can attest to that
[12:37] guybrush: well they are both very cool, i prefer dnode
[12:37] chapel: and not exactly
[12:38] guybrush: i am literally in love with dnode actually :p
[12:38] chapel: nowjs does one thing dnode does, but dnode does so much more
[12:38] chapel: also dnode is language agnostic
[12:38] chapel: so you can hook into ruby/java whatever
[12:38] JacobSingh: chapel: cool thanks I'll start with it then
[12:38] chapel: and isn't just for browser communication
[12:39] chapel: but don't take our word for it, :P
[12:39] tmedema: quacksalot: no, it's a complex story really -- basically I need to use a binary post and link that to a websocket connection.
[12:39] chapel: no input on json validation?
[12:39] guybrush: dnode even can be used to talk tls-streams!
[12:39] `3rdEden: but nowjs has yc funding ;)
[12:40] `3rdEden: sitting on a pile of money always helps with development

[12:41] Rodtusker has joined the channel
[12:42] JacobSingh: Sorry, stupid question but does dnode / socket.io need to run on a different port than express?
[12:42] guybrush: no
[12:42] guybrush: you can attach dnode to your express-server
[12:43] tmedema: the way I see it dnode is at a better state atm but now may have more potential
[12:43] guybrush: just do dnode().listen(expressServer)
[12:43] malkomalko has joined the channel
[12:43] guybrush: tmedema: why is that?

[12:44] chapel: potential? now.js is just browser stuff, and thats all they seem to be interested in
[12:44] tmedema: guybrush: why now may have more potential? because they have a paid team working on it; and they're focusing on a cluster version
[12:44] guybrush: dnode is more like put small parts together to make it work, nowjs is more like take this to own everything
[12:44] chapel: dnode is more like node, in that it is a robust tool, that can be added onto to make it do whatever you want with middleware

[13:16] clip: hi i'm still trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong with npm. I have version 1.0.6, the node_modules dir is in my node-server folder. Now when i install modules with npm i can't require them in a server.js. what did i do wrong??
[13:16] chjj: well, it includes libev now
[13:16] chjj: its bundled with libev
[13:16] chjj: so im guessing the "v" is taken out of there
[13:17] guybrush: clip: cd into the dir where your server.js lives and do npm install <whatever> you should be able to require(<whatever>) then
[13:18] chjj: clip: your directory structure looks like /node-server/node_modules and node-server/server.js ?
[13:18] caike: clip: is you server.js in the same dir as your node_modules ?
[13:18] clip: ahh, no that seems to be ther problem

[13:50] telemachus: How did you install npm? (globally/via sudo or somesuch?)
[13:51] rostayob: what? why would it do that?
[13:51] rostayob: oh, right
[13:51] rostayob: it does
[13:51] telemachus: rostayob: One sec, I'll get you the link
[13:51] rostayob: i want to install it just for my use
[13:51] rostayob: r
[13:51] rostayob: it actually put it both in the pwd/node_modules
[13:51] Aikar: rostayob: ~/.npm is a cache folder, if a module has a bin you need you need to sudo npm install blah -g
[13:51] rostayob: and in the .npm dir
[13:51] telemachus: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/05/01/npm-1-0-released/

[13:52] devrim has joined the channel
[13:52] telemachus: where would it go? $HOME/local?

[13:54] telemachus: I like the way npm handles things now, though I suppose I see your point for a third option
[13:54] telemachus: first two being per-app/isolated or system-wide
[13:54] rostayob: it's strange that noone feels the need of something like that :P
[13:54] rostayob: i mean most of the times you'd like to install an untrusted package like that user wise
[13:55] telemachus: rostayob: Most of the time I want it in $(pwd)/node_modules
[13:55] telemachus: I like that isolation
[13:55] rostayob: oh right
[13:55] telemachus: I don't even want it on my user's path
[13:55] rostayob: so a per project thing
[13:55] rostayob: yeah

[13:58] rostayob: ok
[13:58] rostayob: are those stories true? about how they "motivate" employees and stuff like that
[13:58] telemachus: I just work here and here they use Macs. It is what it is.
[13:59] rostayob: anyway
[13:59] telemachus: For me it's a demotivator, but I like my job (teacher + sys-admin), so it's fine. I don't work in software per se. So no idea how they motivate people there.

[14:12] tiemonster: depends
[14:12] tiemonster: what OS? how did you install them?
[14:13] tmedema: Maybe a stupid question, but in Javascript, can you delete a property within the function that is set to that property, eg: https://gist.github.com/968572 ?
[14:13] nurb: tiemonster: Ubuntu, the newest version via nvm
[14:13] tiemonster: you mean npm?
[14:14] nurb: tiemonster: no, i mean nvm - node version manager
[14:14] tiemonster: never heard of it
[14:14] tiemonster: ACTION googles
[14:15] lukstr: nurb: it means the user has a version of node on his path that is overriding the system wide install
[14:15] lukstr: so something is borked
[14:15] tiemonster: tmedema: even if it's possible, I wouldn't recommend it. besides, even if the first delete was successful, in theory the second would never run.
[14:15] nurb: lukstr: obviously :(:(
[14:16] tiemonster: nurb: which do you want to keep?
[14:16] tiemonster: root's or users' ?
[14:16] lukstr: nurb: you can't really *force* the user to not mess up their path
[14:16] chalaschek has joined the channel
[14:16] tiemonster: unless he's the user
[14:16] lukstr: heh
[14:16] tiemonster: he/she. guess I shouldn't assume.
[14:16] tmedema: tiemonster: why would the second never run? the first command merely removes a property, it does not remove the actual function
[14:16] nurb: tiemonster: the one the current user is using (which is a sudoer) but i need sudo to listen(80) 
[14:17] nurb: tiemonster: and this is where i FAIL
[14:18] strmpnk has joined the channel
[14:18] nurb: tiemonster: because then i run the same thing only "sudo samething" but then all the modules are old 
[14:18] lukstr: nurb: so you want the user to use the system wide install?
[14:18] lukstr: did you run nvm with sudo?
[14:18] tiemonster: nurb: sounds like a mess
[14:18] nurb: lukstr: no 
[14:18] nurb: lukstr: sudo doesnt know what nvm is even
[14:19] lukstr: huh
[14:19] nurb: lukstr: o_O
[14:19] lukstr: sudo doesn't need to know anything
[14:19] nurb: lukstr: i hate sudo

[14:20] nurb: lukstr: hrmff don't think so lemme check
[14:20] tmedema: tiemonster: hmm?
[14:20] lukstr: nurb: you can absolutely give your user root priviledges but it's frowned upon
[14:20] tmedema: tiemonster: ah yes, typo
[14:21] lukstr: nurb: so how do you run nvm?
[14:21] tmedema: was just an example
[14:21] nurb: lukstr: what do you mean how
[14:21] tiemonster: tmedema: http://pastebin.com/jMS4wbNG
[14:21] lukstr: what do you type to run nvm
[14:22] mynyml has joined the channel
[14:22] tiemonster: nurb: best practice would be to install globally what you need root to have access to
[14:22] lukstr: you know, it looks to me like you should just remove nvm from the picture.
[14:22] tmedema: tiemonster: what's up with that paste?
[14:22] tiemonster: tmedema: so nothing is deleted. at least in V8.

[14:27] tiemonster: tmedema: yeah, so... I guess that's ok...
[14:27] lukstr: nurb: but that's what I do personally
[14:27] tiemonster: ACTION bookmarks jsfiddle.net ;-)
[14:27] nurb: lukstr: WHAT .. ok ....

[14:28] Remoun has joined the channel
[14:29] _jdalton has left the channel
[14:30] lukstr: nurb: most web services don't run as root for security reasons, so using something like nginx which runs as root to bind ports then switches to an unpriveledged user is easy. You can probably do the same with node, but I couldn't tell you how. Running a nodejs app as root is probably a bad idea
[14:31] chrisbu has joined the channel
[14:31] jbpros has joined the channel
[14:31] nurb: lukstr: but isnt it a overhead to converse with nginix for each request?
[14:31] Corren has joined the channel
[14:32] lukstr: nurb: of course but it's very small
[14:33] lukstr: nurb: nginx is one of the better solutions, the overhead is negligable for the most part. Something like apache would be too, except there is a thread limit.
[14:34] nurb: lukstr: ok thanks maybe ill just change the port (but then FB doesn't like that)
[14:34] lukstr: nurb: if you're using ubuntu: try privbind, it seems to do the trick

[14:35] robhawkes has joined the channel
[14:35] lukstr: so that would allow it to bind to port 80 and then drop root priveledges, which is better than just running as root

[14:36] enzo: little question, if I code a node.js server with socket.io, how can I make access to the latter on the port 80 ? the answer is passProxy I guess, but it will work only for long polling clients, and not websocket clients no ?
[14:37] chau has joined the channel
[14:37] lukstr: enzo: run it on a different port
[14:37] gmci has joined the channel
[14:38] enzo: lukstr: so I run my apache on 80 and the node.js+socket.io on port 8080 for example ok, but how can I let my user access the nodejs via the port 80 ?
[14:38] Rob- has joined the channel
[14:38] chau has left the channel
[14:38] enzo: imagine my user are behind a firewall that forbids 8080
[14:39] lukstr: enzo: I use nginx instead of apache because apache has issues handling a lot of requests, but for a small number of requests you can just do a reverse proxy with apache
[14:40] brianc1: enzo: lukstr: last time I checked, nginx does not reverse-proxy to socket.io correctly
[14:40] yhahn has joined the channel
[14:40] lukstr: brianc1: interesting, one second
[14:40] enzo: ok so I do that lukstr, but it will work only for long polling clients and not for pure websocket clients that handle a connection no ?
[14:40] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[14:41] cloudhead_ has joined the channel
[14:41] cloudhead has joined the channel
[14:41] enzo: my question is for websocket clients indeed (not long polling client where reverse proxy is ok)
[14:41] brianc1: matter of fact, I wasn't able to find any software proxies that handled web-sockets.  What the response to me at the time was "relax, put node on port 80, and have a beer" which I have been doing to good effect since the recommendation
[14:41] lukstr: brianc1: seeing as that is not often possible I'm interested in a solution now
[14:42] enzo: brianc1: but if you run node on port 80, there's no php module available for your page and so on
[14:42] lukstr: enzo: you can make node do the routing
[14:42] Lorentz: Let node be the reverse proxy then?
[14:42] lukstr: the issue is nginx closes after routing
[14:43] enzo: I prefer a well known webserver as apache or nginx in the front indeed
[14:43] enzo: and route the websocket/long polling clients
[14:43] lukstr: looks like it's impossible with nginx currently
[14:43] enzo: but I guess it's not possible...
[14:43] brianc1: if you need socket.io on 80 i think you could set up a separate sub-domain for the socket.io server...
[14:43] lukstr: apparently HAProxy can do it
[14:43] aconbere has joined the channel
[14:44] `3rdEden: nawww no subdomain
[14:44] enzo: yes brianc1 not a bad idea, 
[14:44] `3rdEden: it is a bad idea
[14:44] `3rdEden: as you will disable allot of high quality transports
[14:44] enzo: `3rdEden: brianc1 meant another domain, and using port 80 on it
[14:44] `3rdEden: because not all socket.io transports are cross domain compatible
[14:44] enzo: ? `3rdEden ?
[14:44] baudehlo has joined the channel
[14:45] `3rdEden: i can't type that fast lol
[14:45] `3rdEden: why don't you add node-http-proxy on port 80? it seems to be able to proxy websocket requests
[14:45] `3rdEden: and have that proxy between your php and node app
[14:46] enzo: lukstr: HAProxy works with apache or nginx ? (or both)
[14:46] lukstr: enzo: I assume it's the same class as something like nginx
[14:46] sooli has joined the channel
[14:47] enzo: hum `3rdEden you mean nginx on port 80 + node-http-proxy, that proxy towards node.js running on port 8080 for example ?

[14:48] enzo: but `3rdEden I don't understand why a subdomain is a bad idea ? seems perfect, no proxy at all
[14:48] enzo: only another IP, and using port 80 on it
[14:48] `3rdEden: because it's considered cross domain
[14:48] `3rdEden: when a browser doesn't support websockets or flash
[14:48] `3rdEden: it will fallback to polling
[14:48] `3rdEden: XHR polling for example, and XHR can't be used cross browser
[14:48] enzo: socket.io doesn't support cross domain ?
[14:48] enzo: well it can `3rdEden
[14:48] micheil: most browsers support either websockets or flash.
[14:49] `3rdEden: It's not a limitation of socket.io it's a limitation of the browsers
[14:49] enzo: no
[14:49] enzo: it's a limitation of socket.io
[14:49] `3rdEden: sure, socket.io is gonna ship an internal browser that will allow IE7 to do cross browser XHR
[14:49] enzo: indeed i've coded a websocket server, i can run it on ip:port different than the main ip:80, and it rocks
[14:49] enzo: => socket.io has to handle the OPTIONS query for that
[14:50] `3rdEden: it supports all that
[14:50] `3rdEden: but that doesn't mean that there are browser that doesn't do / support it
[14:50] lukstr: enzo: there will still be cases where a certain browser will not work at all with your app
[14:50] `3rdEden: and if you go cross domain these will fallback to json polling for example
[14:50] clip has joined the channel
[14:50] rfay has joined the channel
[14:51] `3rdEden: and there is nothing what socket.io can do about that, as it already leverages all existing web techonologies to create a peristent real time stream of information
[14:51] enzo: ok, gonna test the OPTIONS support on other browsers to have an idea
[14:52] enzo: you think some famous browsers still doesn't support this `3rdEden ?
[14:52] seivan has joined the channel
[14:52] `3rdEden: i'm not talking about the famouse high end browser, im referring to the crappy ie5,6,7, ff 2.0, opera 9 etc
[14:53] halfhalo: nobody likes those.
[14:53] `3rdEden: it might not be significat amount of your traffic, but they are still part of your traffic
[14:53] enzo: yes, but how many % do they represent

[14:55] lukstr: enzo: realistically you can circumvent css restrictions pretty easily on all modern browsers that have css enforcement, so the problem is fairly moot. Still, it's probably best to avoid it if possible, but I wouldn't redesign anything because of it
[14:55] halfhalo: I stand by my last major rev - one for browser support rule, but with fancy stuff I always make sure the site can work without it
[14:55] Sammy has joined the channel
[14:56] lukstr: enzo: you could always hack something horrific on in the case your XHR is denied and just harass a same domain page that will proxy for you, but that is so ugly I don't even want to think about it
[14:56] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[14:56] enzo: perfect solution is the tcp proxy
[14:57] enzo: but is it stable, that's the question...
[14:57] lukstr: heh, yes
[14:57] lukstr: it would seem it is used fairly often
[14:57] lukstr: with nginx
[14:57] enzo: gonna look for a tcp proxy under apache, I'm not using nginx for now, maybe I'll switch one day, if a benchmark convinces me

[14:59] clip: hello. since few days i'm trying to figure out how to configure a server so that i can connect from webbrowser and flash. the http-server worked fine with socket.io, but i couldn't connect from flash. than i noticed that i can connect to a tcp-server from flash, but not the web-browser? anyone good a good advice please??
[14:59] aaronblohowiak: but those are all new releases in the last 6 hours =(
[14:59] enzo: much easier in what way lukstr ? for tcp proxy ?
[14:59] lukstr: enzo: no just everything in general, apache drives me up the wall
[14:59] baudehlo: wow, lots of releases for 6 hours.
[15:00] lukstr: enzo: nginx just felt right
[15:00] lukstr: and I had it default onto apache so apache can still handle crap under it
[15:00] enzo: it performs rewriting, php module, deflate, and so on lukstr ?
[15:00] lukstr: yes
[15:00] lukstr: er
[15:00] lukstr: not php module directly, but you just proxy something that does I guess
[15:00] enzo: oh
[15:01] lukstr: so if I want php I'll use apache :P

[15:06] OprahWeLoveYou: To convert stuff like %20 to spaces and %2C to ,
[15:06] lukstr: enzo: there you go :) I'm in a hating on php phase so I give bad advice
[15:06] eldios: use a dedicated module which does urlescaping?
[15:07] OprahWeLoveYou: Or just do some rregular expression replaces?
[15:07] eldios: OprahWeLoveYou, look for sanitizing modules or such
[15:07] aconbere has joined the channel
[15:07] eldios: we if you feel like you're 110% thath you will sanitize every possible combination you would need
[15:07] eldios: do so =)
[15:08] OprahWeLoveYou: We're trying to minimize dependence on modules in order to limit the exposure of our large, commercial project to node.js changes.
[15:08] eldios: fork a stable working sanitizing module
[15:08] eldios: and keep it inside your project
[15:08] OprahWeLoveYou: Had to do that with brianc's pg module to fix bugs in it for a while
[15:09] OprahWeLoveYou: But now in new versions pg is fixed :)
[15:10] lukstr: OprahWeLoveYou: just rip out the heart of a urlescaping module, most of them are pretty similar and tiny from what I've seen

[15:26] bloodsucker: prefered*
[15:27] tbranyen: you mean framework
[15:27] tbranyen: :)
[15:27] tbranyen: its a language in the same way american is a language

[15:32] tbranyen: i never would have guessed
[15:32] lukstr: tbranyen: you mean embedded webkit or making games in html5? because it's still a ways off I'd say

[15:33] tbranyen: wait i didn't say that
[15:33] tbranyen: but i meant it!
[15:33] bloodsucker: +serverSide controller using socket.io in node.
[15:33] lukstr: yeah but angry birds is a casual game. Casual games have almost always existed in that market space. It would be nice to see some real hard core stuff
[15:34] bloodsucker: i am working in a real game engine for a real game in browser.
[15:34] bloodsucker: ...with isometric perspective xD
[15:34] bloodsucker: in the past i choosed canvas for the draw part.... but it is slowly by some reasons
[15:35] bloodsucker: So my games renders directly using html (better! :P)
[15:35] lukstr: huh
[15:35] bloodsucker: because it doesn't re-render each 1/60 seconds.
[15:35] bloodsucker: sorry for my english.
[15:35] guigouz: bloodsucker: are you using any specific library for client side rendering ?
[15:36] bloodsucker: guigouz, no. Mootools and my mind... it is too easy.
[15:36] lukstr: no worries, I'm just confused about the directly using html part, you mean rendering with html elements rather than to a surface (webgl/canvas)
[15:36] bloodsucker: lukstr, exactly.

[15:38] bloodsucker: EvanCarroll, using CSS3
[15:38] bloodsucker: EvanCarroll, yes :D
[15:38] EvanCarroll: but that's a canvas.
[15:38] bloodsucker: See the css files of my project. The "isometric" css class exactly.
[15:38] test: css?
[15:38] bloodsucker: EvanCarroll, no
[15:38] bloodsucker: is css not canvas
[15:38] test: this a node forum
[15:38] bloodsucker: test, sorry test.

[15:39] bloodsucker: EvanCarroll, isn't canvas.

[15:39] EvanCarroll: 10:38 < bloodsucker> Please, see the demo: http://kinebox.com/demo/cabocity/main.html
[15:39] bloodsucker: yes
[15:39] EvanCarroll: 			<canvas id="grid"  width="1024" height="600" ></canvas> 
[15:39] EvanCarroll: right on that page.
[15:39] bloodsucker: EvanCarroll, is ONLY for the grid (sorry ) :P
[15:39] lukstr: EvanCarroll: all the tiles are elements, transformed
[15:40] bloodsucker: guigouz, yes, it works, but you should add roads
[15:40] guigouz: links aren't working here
[15:40] bloodsucker: add a road to the more right coor.
[15:40] bloodsucker: then click the first "demo" link
[15:40] bloodsucker: and see whats happends :P
[15:40] nibblebot: what are folks' preferred console.log enhancer? color, show filename, line number, etc
[15:40] bloodsucker: For test demo links do: add a road in the most right corner to other coor.
[15:40] bloodsucker: then click
[15:41] nibblebot: and also I guess syslogging util
[15:41] guigouz: now i got it

[16:03] bloodsucker: in fact i thought that PHP was "la rehostia" and now...!
[16:04] bloodsucker: guigouz, yes, but only in part. The real conclusion is an application is in server and client side...
[16:04] guigouz: php is still my preferred language for business solutions (basically crud), but now my server side scripts only output json, which is processed on the client.
[16:05] bloodsucker: you know someone general or rules for a communicaton between server and client using json?
[16:05] bene1 has joined the channel
[16:05] bloodsucker: somethings*
[16:06] guigouz: basically that's defined by REST

[16:08] [algo]: hello
[16:08] guigouz: bloodsucker: there's a new pattern called MVVM which should be what MVC was in the 2000s (rails and stuff)
[16:08] bloodsucker: but i will read more about this
[16:08] systemfault: REST is just a cool term to say "use HTTP"
[16:08] [algo]: how can I res.render with non-200 code in Express ?
[16:08] c4milo: bloodsucker: and it should be hypermedia driven 
[16:08] guigouz: bloodsucker: there's a nice js implementation called knockoutjs - www.knockoutjs.com
[16:08] tjholowaychuk: [algo]: res.render(whatever, { status: n })
[16:08] tjholowaychuk: or res.statusCode = n
[16:08] [algo]: tjgillies: thanks!
[16:08] guigouz: c4milo: that's it =)
[16:08] bloodsucker: thnaks another time! :P
[16:08] [algo]: (not found in docs)
[16:09] c4milo: Rest in Practice is a really good book to start with 
[16:09] bloodsucker: guigouz, i will download this book 8-) 
[16:09] c4milo: although there some things I disagree 
[16:09] bloodsucker: or check in the school library.

[16:16] tjholowaychuk: forever seems to be for generic commands only really
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: so probably not as ideal

[18:09] brianc1: ryah: why rename liboio to libuv?

[18:10] brianc1: i thought oio sounded so cool
[18:10] isaacs: wadey: why?
[18:10] isaacs: wadey: you mean, install in a folder not called node_modules?  no chance.
[18:10] wadey: isaacs: I'm trying out using npm to make debian packages: https://github.com/simplegeo/cluster/blob/master/debian/rules#L5-7
[18:11] wadey: but I have to do an extra step to mv the folder afterworks
[18:11] gtramont1na: tjholowaychuk: Thanks for the fix dude, but I need to report another little issue. If I declare the variable inside the @keyframes, it doesn't compile.
[18:11] isaacs: wadey: that'll also break the symlinks.
[18:11] wadey: right, thats why it would be easier if I can change npm.dir
[18:11] isaacs: wadey: just accept it.  bury the node_modules folder in whatever folder debian requires you to use.
[18:11] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:11] tjholowaychuk: gtramont1na within one of the frame blocks? or @keyframes ?
[18:11] isaacs: wadey: changing the name of node_modules is prohibitively complicated.  that assumption is everywhere in the code.
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: gtramont1na: I might have to tweak things a bit for it to work within the main @keyframes block
[18:12] isaacs: wadey: it seems like a simple thing to change.  i tried it once.  it's a Bad Idea.  it'd be a rewrite.  not happening, sorry.
[18:12] isaacs: wadey: just change the --prefix, and then set up your own symlinks.
[18:12] wadey: isaacs: yeah I understand that, but I would rather not have debian packages install to node_modules
[18:12] gtramont1na: Like this: https://gist.github.com/969111
[18:12] isaacs: wadey: then write your own npm ;)

[18:29] sleeplessinc has joined the channel
[18:29] sarkis: just curious how do you guys handle trailing slashes in express.js/
[18:29] sarkis: for example if i route foo a '/foo' /foo/ doesn't resolve and likewise if you reverse that..
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: sarkis: they are implicitly optional
[18:30] tjholowaychuk:  /foo/ and /foo will route to the same callback
[18:30] sarkis: think it would be reasonable to have express.js add a / and re-run it through the routes similar to how jango does?
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: (unless you use a regexp)
[18:30] sarkis: hmmm
[18:30] sarkis: tjholowaychuk: how would you route so it doesnt matter if / is appended
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: when express constructs the regexp it's always followed by \/?
[18:30] sarkis: app.get('/foo', function(req, res){
[18:31] duncanbeevers: I think if you want both the resolve to the same thing, you should make it optional with \/?
[18:31] sarkis: oh i see
[18:31] sveimac has joined the channel
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: duncanbeevers: express does that for you
[18:31] duncanbeevers: There are some really major differences with how different browsers deal with cookie-paths depending on whether the trailing slash is present or not.

[18:33] sleeplessinc_ has joined the channel
[18:33] sarkis: duncanbeevers: interesting, i was thinking about making this more uniform...
[18:34] sarkis: i may just fork express.js and try this out :)
[18:34] sarkis: i basically would like to just specify /foo/ and when express runs throug the routes when i hit /foo, it will append the / and try to run through the routes again before a 404 is returned
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: the regexp does that for you lol
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: ACTION confused
[18:35] sarkis: so my routes would be app.get('/foo/', function(req, res){
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: why not just use app.get('/foo', ...)?
[18:35] sarkis: tjholowaychuk: so it was to duncanbeevers point of how cookiepaths are diff
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: ah
[18:36] sarkis: but i shouldnt fix something thats not broken :) ill just keep in mind that there _might_ be cookie issues depending on the /
[18:36] sarkis: and do some testing around that first
[18:36] admc1 has joined the channel
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: if that really is an issue res.cookie() would be the place to fiddle with the trailing slash

[18:54] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: ultimately it doesnt really matter

[20:38] djcoin has joined the channel
[20:39] syskk: ok

[20:40] c4milo: chjj: I am reviewing the documentation and I didn't find them that's why I am asking
[20:40] bronson: aaronblohowiak, true, Solaris was particularly bad back in the day.  Tends not to be an issue with more modern OSes.

[21:36] tim_smart: bronson: To answer your question, with the smaller operations, speed can be up to 10x faster. For larger operations working with binary, it made it a little slower.

[21:57] NetDooh: We are using net server.listen() and sending a test of 1000 TCP messages a second. The problem we think, is that the buffer is probably filling faster than the write command is flushing. The result, is that ondata does not contain a single message, but in fact multiple.
[21:58] bronson: NetDooh, tcp is a streaming protocol.  Sounds like you expect it to go in chunks?
[21:59] zpao has joined the channel
[21:59] NetDooh: Humm, so, do we need to terminate messages? How do we do this, if we don't control the client messages
[21:59] bronson: Yeah, you need some sort of protocol.
[21:59] bronson: Routers are free to fragment and join packets however they want.
[22:00] NetDooh: So, how is this usually worked out. We are listening for incoming packets, of various formats
[22:00] bronson: Today is repeated word day today.  Word.
[22:00] boghog: fragmented tcp packets get joined in the OS tcp stack though, so that kind of splitting/joining isn't somethng you end up seeing at the application level, or am I wrong?

[22:16] NetDooh: @Bronson, so we have 
[22:17] NetDooh: @Bronson, so we don't have any control over incoming messages, and the client socket. All we have is the net server.listen()
[22:17] xeodox: In Node.js, how can I get the 'public DNS' of the EC2 instance? If I do "os.getNetworkInterfaces()"....I only get Amazon's private IP, but not their public DNS.  How? 
[22:18] bronson: NetDooh, there must be a way to split the incoming data back into packets.
[22:18] bronson: For instance, HTTP separates headers with \r\n.  No matter what size packets you receive, you can always reassemble the headers.
[22:19] NetDooh: @Bronson, we don't have control, how can we spilt the data. The incoming data is from devices, sensors, guages, etc, not HTTP
[22:19] hybsch has joined the channel
[22:19] bronson: NetDooh, right, they must use some sort of protocol.
[22:19] NetDooh: There is no way to terminate messages.
[22:19] bronson: Sending 12\n13\n14\n
[22:19] bronson: If they sent "121314" that would be crazy.
[22:20] NetDooh: Ok, yeah they are TCP, so there is a header
[22:20] NetDooh: Whats the easy way to split on this
[22:21] mscdex: you have to know how the incoming data is structured first
[22:21] wadey has joined the channel

[22:23] slickplaid: has anyone done a lot of work with html5 video in node.js? Looking to start a project with html5/flash video using node.js in the mix. Any suggestions for information on previous projects current or abandoned?
[22:23] arlolra has joined the channel
[22:23] bronson: NetDooh, TCP is a single stream.  You can guarantee bytes arrive in a certain order but that's it.
[22:24] bronson: You can't guarantee how many will arrive at once.
[22:26] NetDooh: @Bronson Ok, think I undestand better now. Going to look at the raw packet and try to figure out where each packet starts and stops
[22:26] bronson: NetDooh, excellent
[22:26] mscdex: NetDooh: maybe there is documentation of the format on the internet already, depending on what it is you're parsing

[23:45] tjholowaychuk: glanced at it

[23:46] tjholowaychuk: gf3: I wrote a quick one day lib called "descent" probably not as feature rich but hey
[23:46] qcom: hey tj, how has nib been going?
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: I use a kinda ebnf / peg hybrid though because I dont like arrows
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: more like leg(1)
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: qcom: pretty good
[23:47] gf3: tjholowaychuk: oh neat, I'd love to check it out
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: gf3: on sec I'll show you the gist
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: I didnt implement memoization yet
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: because it slowed things down by about 50%
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: which .. is funny

[23:50] tjholowaychuk: with debugging enabled

[23:51] qcom has joined the channel
[23:51] gf3: oh neat, the syntax is somewhat js-y

[23:52] tjholowaychuk: foo = 'bar' | 'baz' instead of foo <- 'bar' / 'baz'
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: etc
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: or ':' in that case

[23:55] tjholowaychuk: oddly without memoization it's about 25% faster than pegjs
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: and about 150% less code
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: so it's a bit easier to step through with a debugger or w/e
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: or just to look at
[23:56] bronson: 150% less code?  WOW.
