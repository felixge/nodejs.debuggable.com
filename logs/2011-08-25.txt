[00:01] sechrist: are there any nodejs css sprite libs?
[00:01] sechrist: I really don't want to turn these things into sprites manually
[00:01] MUILTFN has joined the channel
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: sechrist data uris?
[00:01] cjheath: thttpd or nginx would be options, but I'd have to use FCGI, and probably make do without a dynamic language. The idea of writing a WS in C++ doesn't thrill me...
[00:01] sechrist: is that supported on all browsers?
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: if it's small stuff you dont repeat much i'd just go with that
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: oh
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: yeah i guess maybe not, I'm lucky and get to ignore all that
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:02] dominictarr: cjheath: what is the application of this, once there is a web server?
[00:02] state has joined the channel
[00:02] cjheath: It's like an RFID reader, but not RFID
[00:02] cjheath: used in biological specimen banks
[00:02] cjheath: works with tags at liuquid notrogen temperatures
[00:02] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: and for javascript minification/etc, do you suggest uglify on express or something like browserify?
[00:03] ttilley has joined the channel
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: sechrist i prefer to do that statically for prod
[00:03] dominictarr: oh, incompatible rfid tech?
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: i think browserify supports some bundling thing
[00:03] cjheath: RFID doesn't work in cryo
[00:03] cjheath: too cold for electronics
[00:03] cjheath: and bar codes fail due to frost
[00:03] dominictarr: crazy.
[00:03] dominictarr: haha.
[00:03] sechrist: wow that's nuts
[00:03] state: Anyone using forever?

[00:04] Sorella has joined the channel
[00:04] cjheath: The device is about the size of an electric kettle
[00:04] walt: and you are going to run a web server on this
[00:04] walt: sounds like a nice project
[00:04] cjheath: dominictarr: Might you be available for some consulting help to get us started with node?
[00:04] vns has joined the channel
[00:05] state: I don't see any reason why my node process keeps crashing. My forever log is just a list of crashes and restarts. This doesn't happen locally, and it doesn't happen when I start the process manually. 
[00:05] cjheath: Lots of small boxes have web servers in them - like ruters for instance
[00:05] Nexxy has joined the channel
[00:05] cjheath: * routers
[00:05] dominictarr: I'd just as sooner help you for free, (or a box of beer)
[00:05] cjheath: :)
[00:05] cjheath: I'm sure that could be arranged
[00:05] kmiyashiro: I would like beer
[00:06] dominictarr: although, if you insisted on paying I'd make it more professional of course.
[00:06] sechrist: mape: did you write something for sprite mapping?
[00:06] walt: all beer will be turned into coffee
[00:06] cjheath: dominictarr: Is your node consulting gig going ok?
[00:06] mape: sechrist: nope, I usually just base64 it
[00:06] dominictarr: yeah, working on nodejitsu.
[00:06] cjheath: I just haven't written anything in node and don't know what packages and extensions to use
[00:07] cjheath: so some getting-started info would be good
[00:07] dominictarr: working on github.com/nodejitsu
[00:07] cjheath: Yeah, right, nice stuff
[00:07] dominictarr: it's pretty straight forward, 
[00:07] sechrist: are there any little things that parse through your css and make them b64 chunks transparently?
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: sechrist if you're using stylus it does for you
[00:08] dominictarr: install latest stable node (compile, but usually just works)
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: does -> can
[00:08] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: can I use normal css with stylus?
[00:08] sechrist: or do Ineed to convert it
[00:08] dominictarr: install npm, (one liner)

[00:10] dominictarr: but swap haml for jade.
[00:10] cjheath: ok
[00:11] dominictarr: not sure what asset pipeline is
[00:11] cjheath: It'll be mostlt REST anyhow, with a HTML/JS front-end
[00:11] dominictarr: there is a binding for sqlite,
[00:11] cjheath: asset pipeline compiled/minifies JS, CSS, embeds images as dataURLs, builds sprite files and rewrites CSS to use them, that sort of stuff
[00:12] mape: tjholowaychuk: Seems search breaks when searching a lot of files?
[00:12] mape: Error: EMFILE, Too many open files *****

[00:13] dominictarr: hmm, I don't know about that. sounds like you could run it statically though?

[00:14] dominictarr: there is a binding for sqlite,
[00:14] bradleymeck: state you still need help?
[00:14] cjheath: yup. Not all that is needed - I don;t bother with sprites and dataurls in my sinatra-stuff for APRIMO
[00:14] dominictarr: but no ActiveRecord like ORM.
[00:14] state: bradleymeck: I'm making a bit of progress by googling around. Seems like this is not so uncommon. I guess just try to capture the uncaughtException?
[00:14] cjheath: No problem, I might build that as with a generator from CQL anyhow
[00:15] dominictarr: most node users seem to lean towards document databases
[00:15] state: bradleymeck: It's a pretty tiny VPS: could be an out of memory error. But, there's literally no one looking at this.
[00:15] cjheath: Yeah, well, no documents in this app
[00:16] bradleymeck: state thats one way, but generally i havent seen any apps go nuts unless they want some env var set and you didnt set it for forever to add. forever start server.js should act pretty much like node server.js
[00:16] dominictarr: so what does it do? it read the cold codes and serves them to... the lab computer?
[00:18] state: bradleymeck: That's what I figured. It's not the end of the world. I'm months from production. It's fine. It seems to be a delayed crash, which is odd. I can try to catch an exception for more information. That seems like the right path, yes?
[00:19] bradleymeck: yes, seems like some env change when using a monitor is occuring
[00:19] state: seems reasonable. thanks!
[00:19] context: state: if your code throws exceptions its usually a good thing to catch them
[00:20] bradleymeck: not always, but logging them and exitting is good

[00:22] tjholowaychuk: finally
[00:22] softdrink: lol
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: watch+make > stupid file watchers
[00:23] state: it seems like if it's a fatal error node or the offending module would throw some error
[00:23] state: i mean log the error
[00:23] state: it just silently crashes (and restarts with forever)

[00:45] Nexxy: nowjs has super simple "broadcasts"
[00:45] alex0: so the app listens to /hit and /see

[00:50] Nexxy: I almost think of them as one module
[00:50] SubStack: well dnode does make heavy use of browserify
[00:50] Nexxy: iz nice but nowjs was way too fisher-price for me

[00:51] isaacs[away]: Nexxy: i agree about dnode
[00:51] ryantm has joined the channel
[00:51] isaacs[away]: Nexxy: though it is perhaps the very model of un-opinionated rpc :)
[00:51] Nexxy: I don't really think of it as software though
[00:51] Nexxy: as silly as it sounds
[00:51] isaacs: nah, it's just "the thing that makes you able to call functions over there"
[00:51] Nexxy: it's metaware
[00:51] isaacs: haha
[00:51] Nexxy: lol
[00:52] isaacs: it's software.  it's just limited in its scope
[00:52] Nexxy: no, I'm redefining and reclassifying software
[00:52] isaacs: it has opinions, they're just the right ones, and so they seem obvious and unopinionated
[00:52] Nexxy: yes, that!
[00:52] Nexxy: deja vu
[00:52] SubStack: isaacs: not having features is a type of opinion ;)
[00:52] isaacs: indeed!
[00:52] isaacs: dnode does expect a certain type of stream interface, though
[00:52] isaacs: and a dnode-protocol understanding thing on the other end of that stream
[00:53] Nexxy: zen and the art of node.js
[00:53] isaacs: and it has the opinion that if you don't want me calling that function, you'd better damn well not show me it
[00:53] SubStack: it's hard to achieve symmetry without that
[00:53] Nexxy: by thinking beyond thinking and non-thinking
[00:53] isaacs: dnode is basically the whole *point* of having a stream interface.
[00:54] isaacs: so that we'd get stuff like that
[00:54] isaacs: and .pipe()
[00:54] isaacs: .pipe() is awesome
[00:54] Nexxy: even better with .hash()
[00:54] Nexxy: afk
[00:54] isaacs: Nexxy: right, cuz then you can calculate the SHA1 and MD5 and stuff
[00:54] isaacs: and stuff it in your .pipe()
[00:54] Nexxy: yeah yeah... crypto ftw <3
[00:54] Nexxy: ... the library.
[00:55] Nexxy: (just to clarify)

[01:10] micheil: is unclear.

[01:17] level09: first of all , the modules (which are installed globally) are not tracked by repository

[01:18] blueadept: i'm just trying replace to spaces with a backslash plus a space
[01:18] micheil: level09: have you even used the latest npm?
[01:18] level09: yes I upgraded
[01:18] micheil: level09: it by default installs modules into the directory you're working on.
[01:18] level09: I think the new one now installs modules locally 
[01:18] isaacs: level09: why are you installing globally?
[01:19] micheil: so if that's your git repo, it'll install the module into a node_modules folder in there
[01:19] isaacs: level09: yes, it installs locally by default now
[01:19] level09: isaacs: I actually started that a few months back
[01:19] level09: well that is a good thing
[01:19] micheil: it's up to you to choose whether to commit those installed modules or not (not recommended for C/C++ modules)
[01:19] isaacs: level09: you can also do `npm submodule blah` and then manage it by `npm explore blah -- git pull origin master`
[01:19] isaacs: level09: if they define a git repo in their package.json, that is
[01:19] micheil: isaacs: npm submodule?
[01:20] micheil: isaacs: woah, when did this cool new thing get added?
[01:20] level09: haven't really used that command before 
[01:20] isaacs: level09: or specify a git url in your package.json like:  "dependencies": { "blah" : "git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish" }
[01:20] isaacs: micheil: not very long ago
[01:20] isaacs: micheil: within the last year or so ;P
[01:20] isaacs: srsly, not sure.
[01:20] isaacs: it's a blur
[01:21] level09: are node modules in general not so stable ? compared to ruby ones for example
[01:21] micheil: isaacs: can I use a git@github.com url?
[01:21] level09: or is it node's problem ? 
[01:22] level09: as it is very hard to debug 
[01:22] level09: or is it just me :D
[01:22] micheil: level09: I'm getting the feeling you haven't played around with node.js much?
[01:22] level09: I'm definitely not as smart as some who are in this channel :D
[01:23] micheil: isaacs: "it's a blur", as in, the last year is? try being me, I was in high school 8-12 months ago. :P
[01:23] level09: but I just have some blocking issues with some of the major modules
[01:23] micheil: level09: my suggestion would be to start playing around, see what things do.
[01:23] micheil: okay, what are the issues?
[01:23] level09: I have pending issues on socket.io
[01:23] level09: and jsdom
[01:23] level09: and mysql
[01:23] level09: actually mysql was resolved
[01:23] isaacs: level09: well, it's almost 20 years younger :)
[01:23] level09: :)
[01:24] isaacs: level09: but the node community is quite active.
[01:24] isaacs: so that counts for an awful lot

[01:25] micheil: oh?
[01:25] isaacs: micheil: or git://git@github.com
[01:25] isaacs: micheil: it has to start with "git" and be a url
[01:25] isaacs: micheil: npm faq

[01:27] ircretary: micheil: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[01:27] micheil: it just looks scary the size of it, and the fact that it does an -rf
[01:27] isaacs: yep
[01:27] isaacs: -r is because some of those are dirs, and -f is becaus some of them are not writable
[01:27] micheil: yeah.
[01:28] isaacs: or just retry the command with sudo
[01:28] micheil: I just don't trust stuff that gives me an -rf to run.

[01:30] isaacs: xerox: yeah, it'd probably be better to print out each file separately
[01:30] isaacs: so you could evaluate them one at a time more easily
[01:30] isaacs: but i think it doesn't even do that now
[01:30] isaacs: it was kind of a pita
[01:30] micheil: isaacs: on failure, you may want to give out the git log as well though.
[01:30] isaacs: micheil: oh, good point
[01:30] isaacs: issue, plz?
[01:31] micheil: github?
[01:31] xerox: :D
[01:31] isaacs: yeah
[01:31] micheil: isaacs: and do you want a back trace?
[01:31] isaacs: back trace?
[01:31] micheil: yeah.
[01:31] isaacs: oh, you mean, what you'er seeing when it does fail?
[01:31] micheil: the npm-debug.log
[01:31] micheil: yeah
[01:31] isaacs: oh, sure, that's helpful
[01:31] isaacs: micheil: you can just gist the file and paste the link if you like
[01:31] micheil: okay.. I'll have to change a few things in it, as it'd give away what I'm currently working on.
[01:31] isaacs: that's easier

[02:24] jesusabdullah: SO
[02:24] jesusabdullah: has anybody done anything interesting with the net module?
[02:24] eazyigz: miels: i assume it was installed globally because I can run node from any directory
[02:25] jesusabdullah: I was thinking, the only real use case I've seen has been silly telnet demos
[02:25] eazyigz: xerox: here is my crontab entry: 0 */3 * * * node /home/campaigns/reporting/scheduler/updateRedeemedBitlys.js > /home/campaigns/reporting/scheduler/scheduler.log
[02:25] miels: I'm trying to find a templating engine for my needs. I have experience with django so I like jinjs for the similar syntax and extension functionality, but there seems to be absolutely no documentation for it. Does anyone have experience/blog posts with jinjs?
[02:25] xerox: eazyigz: it does not run things with dots in its name
[02:25] jesusabdullah: campaigns?
[02:25] miels: I'm mainly trying to figure out how I would organize the code and use it in jinjs
[02:25] xerox: *their name
[02:25] eazyigz: miels: I find that EJS is similar to Django's
[02:26] marcello3d: xerox: really? I'm pretty sure I've run .sh files on crontab before
[02:26] jesusabdullah: micheil: I belive jinjs is very new

[02:26] jesusabdullah: er, not micheil 
[02:26] miels: eazyigz, yea that looks like it would work. That was just my first idea. I'm kind of new to the node scene.
[02:26] jesusabdullah: miels: I believe jinjs is very new
[02:26] eazyigz: jesusabdullah: I made that directory
[02:26] marcello3d: eazyigz: do you have #!/bin/whatever/node on the first line?
[02:26] miels: eazyigz, thanks, I'll look into EJS

[02:29] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Nah, that's not powerful enough.

[02:29] Nuck: And it's proprietary.
[02:29] Nuck: And unserious.

[02:30] Nuck: jesusabdullah: That's the wrong word for it...
[02:30] jesusabdullah: You're right

[02:54] Nuck: Then throw that in the trash

[02:56] Nuck: don't compile from JS
[02:57] marcello3d: but c compiles to machine code… the same argument could be used against c, if you want to code in machine code, use assembly
[02:57] blueadept: ^
[02:58] Nuck: In that case, there was a real reason not to use ASM, since it was extremely complex to maintain.
[02:58] marcello3d: no comment

[03:14] kmiyashiro: not sure why you would have multiple priorities
[03:14] kmiyashiro: er
[03:14] kmiyashiro: I mean not sure why you would have tags be the primary grouper
[03:14] kmiyashiro: seems that tags would be used to filter

[03:15] qbert_: kmiyashiro, Im using it my project ( with just text output ), and I usually tag thinks that I want other people to fix ;).  Like #ui

[07:10] ehaselwanter: does npm install recursively update/ install dependencies?
[07:10] isaacs: ehaselwanter: yeah
[07:10] RC1140 has joined the channel
[07:10] isaacs: ehaselwanter: it doesn't dive into nested deps that are already there, though
[07:10] framlin: jellosea: I would have expected, that new a('bla') would create a "own" property cat within the a-clone with meow === 'bla' but it seems, that the prototypes-cat will be set instead
[07:10] ehaselwanter: can I force it to?
[07:11] isaacs: ehaselwanter: ie, if you have a dependency on foo, and foo -> bar, and you do `npm install`, then it'll skip over foo if it's already there, and not find a new version of bar.
[07:11] isaacs: ehaselwanter: `npm update`
[07:11] RC1140 has left the channel
[07:11] ehaselwanter: so I would do git pull; npm install; npm update ...
[07:12] isaacs: ehaselwanter: oh, no, if it's installing something, it'll get the new version, and it'll install all the deps recursively
[07:12] isaacs: ehaselwanter: it just won't reinstall new versions of  any that are already present
[07:13] isaacs: in the example above, let's say:
[07:13] isaacs: 1. npm install <-- gets foo@1, bar@1
[07:13] isaacs: 2. work work work, time goes by
[07:13] isaacs: 3. bar@2 is released, which is also suitable for foo
[07:13] isaacs: 4. npm install <-- does nothing, foo is already installed
[07:13] isaacs: 5. npm update <-- finds a new suitable bar@2, installs it underneath foo
[07:14] ehaselwanter: got that
[07:14] isaacs: kewl :)
[07:14] ehaselwanter: so if the developer wants to have a newer version as a sep he has to express it with the package.json
[07:15] ehaselwanter: then npm install would "update" that too?
[07:15] isaacs: ehaselwanter: `npm install` with no args will skip over anything that's already present.
[07:15] isaacs: ehaselwanter: but `npm install foo` would get the newest one that's suitable
[07:15] ehaselwanter: ignoring a minimal required version?
[07:16] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:16] isaacs: and overwrite the existing one
[07:16] isaacs: ehaselwanter: suitable = satisfies the requirement in package.json
[07:16] ehaselwanter: that's what I asked ...
[07:16] ehaselwanter: a few lines up .. ;-)
[07:17] ehaselwanter: if there is a higher version required in the package.json
[07:17] ablomen has joined the channel
[07:17] isaacs: so, if you do `npm install foo` and your packagejson has "foo":"~0.3.2" then you'd get a version of foo which is at least 0.3.2, but less than 0.4.0, even if there's an 0.4.1 released
[07:17] isaacs: yes
[07:17] isaacs: ehaselwanter: if there's a bar at the top level, and it's suitable to foo, then foo won't get another copy
[07:17] dob_ has joined the channel
[07:18] ehaselwanter: and that is what I wanted to solve
[07:18] ehaselwanter: I got a "bug" report on npm install does not update

[07:19] isaacs: ehaselwanter: feel free to mention @isaacs in npm-related bug reports
[07:19] ehaselwanter: I'm the server guy doing the install
[07:19] isaacs: ok
[07:20] isaacs: `npm install`, without any arguments, does not update existing pacakges.
[07:20] ehaselwanter: npm install does not work. delete node_module and npm install does work
[07:20] isaacs: it only fills in the blanks.
[07:20] isaacs: `npm install foo` will install foo
[07:20] ehaselwanter: that's what I got
[07:20] isaacs: `npm update` will update existing packages.
[07:20] ehaselwanter: and I though. what if I do a npm install; npm update
[07:20] isaacs: then that's fine
[07:20] isaacs: but why are you having to do that?  i don't udnerstand
[07:20] ehaselwanter: what?
[07:20] isaacs: are there deps bundled in the git repo?
[07:21] lorinc has joined the channel
[07:21] ehaselwanter: the app relies on a package which expresses its dependencies

[07:22] ehaselwanter: git pull npm install fetches the new module.tgz
[07:22] isaacs: ok

[07:24] isaacs: oh... i think i'm getting it: so, the original package has a dep that points at a url?
[07:24] ehaselwanter: so my feedback would include -> hey devs. you are doing something wrong
[07:24] isaacs: "dependencies": { "foo":"http://foo.com/package.tgz" }
[07:24] isaacs: like that?
[07:24] ehaselwanter: yes
[07:24] isaacs: and then foo has dependencies inside it, which are not getting installed
[07:25] ehaselwanter: or updated
[07:25] febits has joined the channel
[07:25] ehaselwanter: yes
[07:25] isaacs: no, they shouldn't be "updated"
[07:25] ehaselwanter: ok
[07:25] isaacs: if they're there already, then npm should leave them alone
[07:25] ehaselwanter: good to know
[07:25] isaacs: developer knows best :)
[07:25] isaacs: but i think leaving them *missing* should be a bug in npm.
[07:25] isaacs: that's valid.  doing `npm update` is a workaround, but not a great one
[07:26] ehaselwanter: i thought of doing a recursive find of all package.json files and a npm install of each versionend
[07:26] ehaselwanter: pacakge
[07:26] ehaselwanter: but that is what npm is for in the first place
[07:27] ehaselwanter: I thought

[07:28] isaacs: ehaselwanter: i think it is
[07:28] isaacs: but just in case, i might have accidentally fixed this :)
[07:29] ehaselwanter: *lol*
[07:29] ehaselwanter: @isaacs thx a lot
[07:29] isaacs: np
[07:29] chjj: i hate it when i accidentally fix things
[07:30] ehaselwanter: to summarize: npm install should do the right thing
[07:30] ehaselwanter: but its broken in this case
[07:30] isaacs: ya
[07:30] isaacs: ehaselwanter: this is the first time this has ever happened.
[07:30] ehaselwanter: npm install; npm update is a workaround
[07:30] isaacs: yes
[07:30] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[07:31] ehaselwanter: and this last sequence has the same effect as
[07:31] ehaselwanter: rm -rf node_modules; npm install

[07:42] pyrotechnick: if 0.6.8 is released when i run npm i against that

[08:02] marlun: garrensmith: Is that preferrable? Then there will be a lot of times created.

[09:20] Ned_: garrensmith: heh, fair enough
[09:21] aaronmcadam: hehe couch is alrighty
[09:21] DrMcKay: Ned_: bu you can also use plain driver like node-mongodb
[09:21] H4ns: Ned_: right.  i'm also looking for something that is more on the language level and makes some data structures persistent by magic.
[09:21] Ned_: H4ns: how are you making your data structures ?
[09:21] Ned_: using any module for that ? (like Backbone for example) ?

[09:22] Ned_: H4ns: I really recommend using something (I'm finding backbone good, but I'm sure there are others that are good too)

[11:02] robinduckett: Layke: nowjs / socket.io?
[11:02] Layke: H4ns, I'm new, so inexperienced. :) I'm using socket.io
[11:02] Layke: Basically, I am trying to create a message notification system.
[11:02] robinduckett: Layke
[11:02] robinduckett: look into nowjs
[11:02] robinduckett: if you can
[11:03] robinduckett: it's based on socket.io
[11:03] Layke: I'm flexible and will use anything which will make my task easier.
[11:03] robinduckett: it syncs a bucket on local and server
[11:03] Layke: Okay, how would that help?
[11:03] robinduckett: http://nowjs.com/
[11:04] robinduckett: you can run a function from the browser and it calls the server and returns asynchronusly
[11:04] robinduckett: and variables sync too
[11:04] robinduckett: so you can do now.user_id = 'My user'
[11:04] robinduckett: and the server can pick that up
[11:04] robinduckett: or you can do now.set_username('My user');
[11:04] robinduckett: and on the server everyone.now.set_username = function(username) {};
[11:04] Layke: Okay, cause I saw one solution here: http://mattmueller.me/blog/quick-tip-node-js-socket-io-authentication 
[11:05] Layke: But that looked terrible way of doing it.
[11:05] robinduckett: yeah
[11:05] Layke: I would be restricted to the same domain then also I think.
[11:06] robinduckett: Layke: you would be restricted to same domain with anything socket.io
[11:06] Layke: I thought I read in the FAQ that it's cross?
[11:06] robinduckett: whether it's using xhr-polling, iframe or websockets
[11:07] jkwiii has joined the channel
[11:07] robinduckett: hmm
[11:07] robinduckett: it does says it is
[11:07] robinduckett: but i'm not sure how that would work with cookie or session auth
[11:07] robinduckett: hmm nowjs says cross domain support too
[11:08] robinduckett: I wonder how they do that
[11:08] Layke: robinduckett, What I'm trying to do is create a notification system. Just a simple "1" or "5" for how many messages the user has unread. Like Facebook notifications. My application is built using PHP and MySQL. Messages are added to mySQL via many different sources. For example my developers can add a message via REST PUT, or Send Grid POSTS a message to my application also. Plus users can use the contact form. All of these messages get added t
[11:08] Layke: o my application. 
[11:08] Layke: Is this a bad design for socket.io/nodejs? How can I integrate this event based notifications without changing my application too much?
[11:09] H4ns: Layke: why don't you send the session identifier through socket.io to your server?
[11:09] robinduckett: H4ns: was just about to say that
[11:09] H4ns: Layke: (if you can access the sessions that the http server uses)
[11:09] robinduckett: Layke: also, if you're polling mysql to get the notifications, do you even need to use nodejs?
[11:10] Layke: robinduckett,  My plan would be to not poll.
[11:10] Layke: I was thinking about When messages are added via my application, they all go through the same Model class. So I could easily add some event when a new message gets added.
[11:10] robinduckett: I see
[11:10] Layke: I'm really just looking for direction cause I do not want to poll mysql every 10 seconds for each user.
[11:10] robinduckett: Of course
[11:11] robinduckett: well if you have a way to get PHP to notify nodejs when a user has a new message then it should be okay
[11:11] robinduckett: but I don't know enough about nowjs or socket.io to tell you how the cross domain stuff works

[11:13] Layke: robinduckett,  then my job server would notify node.js of the message.
[11:13] Layke: I asked this question yesterday on Stack Overflow.. it's basically a summary of what I just said: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7182877/architecture-implementation-and-design-for-a-notification-system-using-socket-io
[11:16] mldevbrissy has joined the channel
[11:16] Layke: robinduckett, And would it be correct to assume, that what I want to do, is that when a user connects for the first time, that I should have socket.io query my `messages` table for the total count of unread messages.

[11:28] DrMcKay: someone should definitely set title to "Anniversary!"
[11:31] Layke: DrMcKay, do you think my proposed solution would work? All my messages are inserted to mysql. I want to provide a notification system to users when they receive a new message. So when I receive a new message, add the message and create a new job on my job server which tells it to notify node.js of the event? 
[11:31] DrMcKay: Layke: sure
[11:32] Layke: I wouldn't have a clue how else I could even store my messages. Messages are emails, enquiries, personal/private messages etc.
[11:32] DrMcKay: and the node.js talks to user over web sockets or dnode?
[11:32] Layke: Yeah, socket.io 
[11:32] DrMcKay: Layke: yeah, should work :)
[11:32] zilch_ has joined the channel
[11:32] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[11:32] Layke: And am I correct to think, that when a user first connects to node for the first time. Or conents to socket.io, that I have node query my messages table for their current total count of unread messages?
[11:33] Layke: Cause , I shouldn't expect node to persist this count at all should I
[11:34] DrMcKay: if your job server notifies node, then node should store queue of notifications without having to talk to DB server
[11:34] felixhummel has joined the channel
[11:35] Layke: DrMcKay, I'm confused though, because lets say when I first start up node, and a user first connects, how will websockets know what Count to respond with.
[11:35] Layke: Does node remember things?
[11:36] DrMcKay: Layke: node is still working
[11:36] DrMcKay: Layke: node isn't like PHP script
[11:36] Layke: But how about when node crashes and I start it back up again. 
[11:37] DrMcKay: Layke: if I understand your concern, you don't know how to identify which user is which and what notifications should he receive?
[11:37] DrMcKay: Layke: oh, then it would be best if you just setup a table for notifications in DB
[11:38] DrMcKay: have node working constantly without any job server
[11:38] DrMcKay: node checks which user connects, queries DB for notifications which he should receive
[11:38] DrMcKay: then pops the notifications
[11:39] Layke: (I think you just answered my question but I typed it anyway) DrMcKay, I haven't gotten to that particular concern yet. That will be next ;) My concern is that, I write my node server, and I have websockets. Now I do a connect on the client to websockets, and I want to return how many notifications there are for this user. I can have my job server notify node when a new messageis received, but what about the first time. 
[11:40] Layke: So on first connect, check my notifications, which would be a simple "SELECT count(*) FROM `messages` where hasRead = 0" 
[11:40] Layke: That will be the only time that node checks the database. 
[11:40] skm has joined the channel
[11:40] Layke: From here on out, when I receive a message in my actual application. I insert it to mysql, then I create a job on my job server, and the job server when it gets the chance notifies node.
[11:41] ay_ has left the channel
[11:41] Layke: That is how I am about to design the notifications application. Correctomundo? Or completely the wrong appraoch.
[11:41] DrMcKay: Layke: yes, you can do it like that
[11:41] DrMcKay: Layke: but, say, when user receives a message, you could insert into notifications table
[11:42] Layke: Ok
[11:42] DrMcKay: Layke: but without using any job server
[11:42] djcoin has joined the channel
[11:42] DrMcKay: I mean, app receives message, inserts into notifications and forgets
[11:42] DrMcKay: node would be constantly lurking around this table
[11:42] Layke: Okay, but DrMcKay, if I do the notification from my application, then how would node know without polling?
[11:42] Layke: Polling would be bad for scalability right?
[11:42] robinduckett: Layke: it wouldn't poll
[11:43] robinduckett: that's the suggestion
[11:43] robinduckett: it would just check the db whenever a user connects
[11:43] zilch_ has joined the channel
[11:43] DrMcKay: true, but I don't think that querying this DB each 30 s would have a result
[11:43] DrMcKay: or how robinduckett says

[11:44] robinduckett: Layke: whenever a user connects to node via socket.js
[11:45] Layke: Okay, so I would be doing a new mysql query every 30s? 
[11:45] robinduckett: and if you're already connected you could have the system update the notitifcation db then connect to node via a socket to tell node to send a notification to a user who is already connected
[11:45] robinduckett: you wouldn't need to poll at all
[11:45] DrMcKay: robinduckett++

[11:49] Layke: hile the user is still browsing my site on the same socket connection, a new message comes in, and a new notification gets added. From my PHP application, I then create a connection to websockets that a new message has been received. 
[11:50] robinduckett: kind of
[11:50] robinduckett: instead, from your PHP application
[11:50] robinduckett: connect via a php tcp socket
[11:50] industrial: What's the best way to clone an object?
[11:50] bosky101 has joined the channel
[11:50] robinduckett: to a nodejs tcp socket server/listener
[11:50] robinduckett: which then goes through the list of connected clients on socket.io
[11:50] robinduckett: finds the right one
[11:50] robinduckett: and sends them the notification
[11:51] Layke: Okay. Just curiously, for a first time using node.js ever and socket.io, is this a difficult task? I'm not inexperienced with developing, but I seem to have obvious issues grasping this. 
[11:51] _kud has joined the channel
[11:51] Layke: I haven't set my heights to high to learn node.js have I?
[11:51] robinduckett: no
[11:52] Lorentz: Layke: It is somewhat different to php, but you'll get it.
[11:52] robinduckett: Layke: do you have NPM?
[11:52] Layke: Yeah I do.
[11:52] robinduckett: okay
[11:52] DrMcKay: Layke: node is really easy
[11:52] robinduckett: right so
[11:52] H4ns: Layke: look at http://nodebeginner.org/ if you have not.
[11:52] Layke: So far I have only installed socket.io That is it.
[11:52] DrMcKay: Layke: I've contributed a patch in my first day with node :)
[11:52] robinduckett: okay you will need to set up an http server as well
[11:52] Layke: H4ns, Adding to bookmarks and reading now :)
[11:52] robinduckett: DrMcKay: yeah but you're a robot
[11:52] DrMcKay: robinduckett: oh, sorry, I keep forgetting :(
[11:53] robinduckett: DrMcKay: and you once blew up a solar system
[11:53] Layke: lol.
[11:53] DrMcKay: robinduckett: that was an accident!
[11:53] DrMcKay: and not my fault.
[11:54] robinduckett: yeah sure meredith
[11:54] robinduckett: :P

[11:54] robinduckett: anyway
[11:55] robinduckett: Layke: you will need to have a httpServer running to host socket.io, yes?
[11:55] Layke: Yeha. 
[11:55] robinduckett: well in node you can also have a TCP Server almost as easily
[11:55] bzinger has joined the channel
[11:55] robinduckett: you know how to use PHP Socket extension?
[11:55] Layke: I'm listening.
[11:56] robinduckett: what i'm saying is, you can have your list of clients on socket.io
[11:56] Layke: Not PHP sockets, but I can pick that up immediately, that wouldn't be an issue. 
[11:56] robinduckett: and you can marry those clients up to their username yes?
[11:56] robinduckett: on your system
[11:56] robinduckett: so it goes like this

[11:57] robinduckett: (it is my lunch break)
[11:57] Layke: Incredible. I'm not going anywhere.
[11:57] Layke: I'll be idling all day.
[11:57] Layke: Hit me up witha  ping.
[11:57] robinduckett: shouldn't take long
[11:58] Layke: I'm going to go to the shop to grab some milk I think. Need my  coffee hit.

[12:22] robinduckett: Layke: could do, but I thought you just wanted a count?
[12:22] robinduckett: either way this is pretty flexible
[12:22] robinduckett: just gives you a rough idea

[12:30] andrewfff has joined the channel
[12:31] robinduckett: So you see what I mean, PHP inserts the data into MySQL and sends a socket_write to your node.js server which checks if the user is online and then sends it to them if they are
[12:31] robinduckett: and if they aren't logged in, PHP uses it's normal methods to check if the user has any notifications
[12:31] rfay has joined the channel
[12:31] brandonramp: good stuff robin
[12:32] Layke: Yeah that looks fantastic. Perfect solution. 
[12:32] devaholic: why not just code it all in node?
[12:32] larsemil has joined the channel
[12:32] Layke: Thanks very much! 
[12:32] threenplusone has joined the channel
[12:32] zilch_ has joined the channel
[12:33] robinduckett: devaholic: you could do but if you already have a PHP stack it's not feasible to replace it really
[12:33] Layke: devaholic, I've already done all of my messaging applications. Messages are inserted to my `messages` table via half a dozen different sources. Users can add a message via API, SendGrid add messages when an email is received. Users browsing my site can submit message enquiries to users. 
[12:33] Wizek has joined the channel
[12:33] Layke: All my messages are inserted from php using the same Model class, so that would be an ideal point to fork off and tell node that a message was received.
[12:33] devaholic: yeah im pretty sure you can do all that in node far easier than php...
[12:34] robinduckett: devaholic: sure, but not if you had already coded it in PHP
[12:34] devaholic: looks kind of frankenstein, but to each his own
[12:34] robinduckett: as PHP has been around a LOT longer than node
[12:34] Layke: devaholic,  possibly  in a few months when I have learnt the ropes, I might come to that convlusion too. But for now, while i've already coded it. :) 
[12:35] devaholic: there's the sauce
[12:35] bosky101 has joined the channel
[12:35] jzacsh has joined the channel
[12:35] devaholic: it seems a common trend to try and meld node.js in with php or something else when people first get started
[12:35] robinduckett: devaholic: that's because php is very approachable
[12:36] Layke: robinduckett,  so you would maintain the notifications count in `notifications` rather than each individual notification and doing a count()?
[12:36] robinduckett: don't get me wrong, node is too
[12:36] devaholic: the server side part of php is nothing like node
[12:36] jtsnow has joined the channel
[12:36] robinduckett: Layke: yeah, the notification count doesn't need to be recalculated
[12:36] devaholic: they wont scale together
[12:36] robinduckett: can be stored in ram
[12:36] robinduckett: devaholic: do me a favor

[12:38] devaholic: have fun
[12:38] robinduckett: I will do thanks :)
[12:38] Layke: robinduckett, What was that way that I can figure out via socket.io who is connected? The user ID of the user?
[12:38] Layke: nowjs? Or was it something else?
[12:38] micheil: ACTION <3 php
[12:39] micheil: (and I'm not even trolling there.)
[12:39] robinduckett: Layke: you can use nowjs or you can use socket.io to send to node some session id or user id which you can then get your data from the mysql database
[12:39] devaholic: dominictarr: no, whats that?
[12:40] dominictarr: it's basically PHP for nodejs
[12:40] dominictarr: https://github.com/mikeal/jspp
[12:40] robinduckett: I made one of them
[12:40] robinduckett: couldn't do async though
[12:40] micheil: usually in a realtime system with node.js, you'll have unique ids for the socket connections, but then you'll pair those server-side with various things that a relevant to your use case`
[12:40] marlun has joined the channel

[12:40] squeese has joined the channel
[12:41] micheil: this may be by sending across some presence type information when your client first connects
[12:41] robinduckett: Layke, micheil yes, sending some kind of unique identifier like username or userid when it connects would be good
[12:41] larsemil has joined the channel
[12:41] robinduckett: awh beaten to the punch
[12:42] brandonramp: guys
[12:42] Layke: Did you have a suggestion of how to implement that micheil ?
[12:42] brandonramp: anyone got a sample app i can look at
[12:42] robinduckett: Layke: you could just echo a variable out into a page from PHP :P
[12:42] robinduckett: brandonramp: for what?
[12:42] H4ns: Layke: lots.  try looking into your log.
[12:42] Layke: robinduckett, already discounted that for security reasons :P 
[12:42] brandonramp: node, just to get started
[12:43] alfborge has joined the channel
[12:43] Layke: brandonramp, H4ns linked this: http://nodebeginner.org/ It was helpful
[12:44] robinduckett: Layke: the only choices you have then
[12:44] robinduckett: is cookie
[12:44] micheil: Layke: I'm just talking with some fellow pusher.com developers about this
[12:44] alfborge: Anyone know what the error yeti throws could indicate: "Can't use mutable header APIs after sent." 
[12:44] robinduckett: or some kind of session store that's accessible from node
[12:45] Layke: micheil, I'll be around poke me if you come up with something. If I can do it cross domain that would be infinitely better. Mya pplication works from hundreds of domains, it's a multi tenant application, so there will be isituations when I know I need to do something cross domain.
[12:45] robinduckett: micheil: did you talk to marak in the end?
[12:45] progme has joined the channel
[12:46] Layke: micheil, pusher.com looks awesome. Is that a subsitute for websockets?
[12:46] micheil: yes
[12:46] micheil: Layke: we've actually got a new feature being released on friday afternoon that is highly relevant in the context of node.js
[12:46] robinduckett: micheil: I think marak thought pusher was a rival nodejs app host :D
[12:47] micheil: robinduckett: no, he deleted all the tweets.

[12:48] robinduckett: or pretend :P
[12:48] fermion has joined the channel
[12:49] micheil: Layke: so, after a quick discussion, we came to the conclusion that possibly a really good way to do user auth over websockets would be this:
[12:49] micheil: 1) on rendering of the html for the page, embed a unique token that is pair to the users session (but perhaps not their cookie), this could be stored in something like a meta tag.
[12:50] albertos_ has joined the channel
[12:50] micheil: 2) onload / onconnect of the websocket, you send a message back to the server that includes your token
[12:50] robinduckett: micheil: can JS pick up meta tags? I literally have no idea, never tried it
[12:50] micheil: 3) server checks that token and pairs the socket_id to the users session
[12:51] micheil: robinduckett: I took the idea of meta tags of this stuff from rails, which uses meta tags for csrf tokens
[12:51] Layke: robinduckett,  yeah, they are apart of the dom so shouldn't be any problem. just d.getElementsByTagNam('meta') etc etc
[12:51] robinduckett: micheil: This is exactly how I do it, except I just use the connect.sid from the cookie and look up the session in my RedisStore
[12:51] Layke: micheil, digesting your approach now.. sec :)
[12:51] robinduckett: because I use connect / express to serve the page with sessions
[12:51] micheil: (you can even access the comments in the HTML via the DOM)
[12:52] robinduckett: that's crazy
[12:52] micheil: robinduckett: yeah; like, you could reuse the cookie, but I'm not sure that's the best way
[12:52] robinduckett: I'm not much of a DOM guy myself
[12:52] micheil: I think having a separate token per socket is better
[12:52] H4ns: micheil: what's the issue with using the sid from the cookie?
[12:52] robinduckett: micheil: the issue was that with now this.user.cookie didn't always get populated
[12:52] robinduckett: automagically
[12:52] micheil: maybe I'm just old school, but I've never found cookies a joy to work with.
[12:53] robinduckett: micheil: maybe not, and you're right, cookies are bad because they are not cross domain
[12:53] micheil: that too.
[12:53] shipit has joined the channel
[12:53] robinduckett: Layke: ignore me, micheil's making sense.
[12:53] Layke: micheil, I love that approach. Cross domain possible then right.
[12:53] devaholic: micheil: why put that in a meta tag and not just set that token as a js var
[12:53] micheil: devaholic: well, you could, but generated javascript in pages sucks.
[12:53] fermion has joined the channel
[12:53] micheil: Layke: cross domain should be possible.
[12:54] robinduckett: devaholic: I think putting it in a meta tag feels cleaner but you could just as well do <script>var js_token = '{{token}}';</script>
[12:54] micheil: you could also have a dynamic JS file that you just load it that has the values, but then you may risk the websocket connecting before you've received that file.
[12:55] robinduckett: micheil: unless you delay connection until dom ready
[12:55] devaholic: i dont see how generated javascript could suck any more than the generated meta tag
[12:55] fermion has joined the channel
[12:55] micheil: also, for those interested, this friday afternoon, the pusher.com guys + @seb_ly will be answering questions on WebSockets for @AskMDN: https://twitter.com/askmdn/status/106315721214140416
[12:55] micheil: devaholic: I dunno, I've just always found generating javascript a pain, personal preference
[12:56] robinduckett: devaholic: Neither do I, I just think it looks cleaner and it's the "ruby" way which people coming from rails to nodejs love
[12:56] Layke: micheil,  Great solution. :) And how would you marry up the token with the user. Would that be done directly from node? Or would node then need to do something else?
[12:56] unlink has joined the channel
[12:56] robinduckett: Layke: in node, you'd have to query the database
[12:56] robinduckett: or the session store
[12:56] micheil: so, you'd store something like a list of sockets to users
[12:56] micheil: erm
[12:56] micheil: tokens to users
[12:56] robinduckett: you could have it as a field in your users table
[12:57] micheil: true
[12:57] Layke: Okay, and just rotate these tokens regularly on connect.
[12:57] robinduckett: yeah
[12:57] Layke: To prevent the obvious hijacking.
[12:57] micheil: but you'd probably want to use redis for something like this
[12:57] robinduckett: infact
[12:57] robi42 has joined the channel
[12:57] robinduckett: probably better to load the user from mysql, store it in redis or an in memory store, and have the token change on login, and not store the token in the db at all
[12:57] micheil: Layke: it'd be unique per session
[12:57] Twelve-60 has joined the channel
[12:58] Layke: Okay, so apart of the Authentication and session start, I should rebuild the token. 
[12:58] micheil: so it'd essentially be 1:1 session -> token mapping

[13:02] robinduckett: blueadept: take it out of a Closure
[13:02] Layke: Cheers micheil :) 
[13:02] blueadept: but is there a way to do it keeping it in closure though
[13:02] robinduckett: Layke: also if you need anyone to protect you from PHP hating bigots let me know
[13:03] robinduckett: blueadept: I don't know, put one closure inside the other?
[13:03] blueadept: the thing is those two separate functions are usually in separate files
[13:03] robinduckett: blueadept: then you need to define your Schema globally
[13:03] blueadept: thats the thing, i put them in one pastie for context
[13:03] robinduckett: GLOBAL.Schema = mongoose.Schema;
[13:03] blueadept: hm
[13:04] robinduckett: that will work cross files
[13:04] robinduckett: or you could export it as a module export
[13:04] blueadept: ah the module export is what i'm looking for i think
[13:04] adrianmg has joined the channel
[13:04] blueadept: make it module.export.Schema = ? ?
[13:04] robinduckett: var mongoose_schema = require('./Schema').Schema; in your bottom function

[13:04] blueadept: i see
[13:04] robinduckett: in the top file
[13:05] robinduckett: then you can do

[13:20] rabidmachine9: I'm trying to retreive all elements from a collection in mongodb
[13:20] seemann: Morning, y'll. I have a simple question, but can't seem to solve it. I have a express server running, with static provider. So far so good, but now I want to check if the user that is accessing my files is authenticated, i added app.use(express.router) to the config funciton, but it keeps returning me this error: Object #<IncomingMessage> has no method 'call'. Any ideas?
[13:21] devaholic: getting nothing for arr?
[13:21] rabidmachine9: no the page won't even load

[13:23] seemann: this is the "server" https://gist.github.com/1170642
[13:23] devaholic: i think that router is already being useed, seemann, are you reading old docs perhaps?
[13:24] devaholic: i could be wrong on that though
[13:24] seemann: devaholic i''m reading the express.js page documentation

[13:32] groom: hi
[13:32] groom: i've got a server that i create with http.createServer(function(request, response) {…}); When I'm done sending data back to the client, I do response.end(). The proplem is: when I use wget as client, the final tcp packet contains the FIN flag whereas when I use php's stream_get_contents that flag is not set, resulting in a waiting client. what could be the reason for that?

[13:50] zilch_ has joined the channel
[13:51] robinduckett: seemann: you'd have to write your own static middleware that checked cookies
[13:51] d3x7r0: seemann, add a route for that file, check the auth there and use next() to serve the file if the person has permissions for it?
[13:51] robinduckett: Or that
[13:51] seemann: if the file exists it goes through the router
[13:52] seemann: get('/images/*')
[13:52] seemann: if there is a /images/img.png, the route is invisible
[13:52] d3x7r0: seemann, switch the order you use to setup the router and static files
[13:52] robinduckett: seemann: if you put the static router second, and your middleware to check auth first, that should work?
[13:53] seemann: that's what i'm trying to do, but once I insert app.use(express.router) this error shows up when I get the file: Object #<IncomingMessage> has no method 'call'
[13:53] d3x7r0: instead of app.setup(express.static); app.setup(app.router); do app.setup(app.router); app.setup(express.static);

[15:19] Glenjamin: perhaps define a routine as "a module which exports a register(mediator) function"
[15:19] tmedema: robinduckett: hmm not sure what you mean with the class based events
[15:19] robinduckett: in the server configurator.js, why is there an event to say which environment you are in?
[15:19] devrim: eazyigz_: what up
[15:20] tmedema: robinduckett: just allows you to debug it in case you want to be sure you are not accidentally in a wrong environment or something
[15:20] robinduckett: tmedema: okay
[15:21] eazyigz_: devrim: have you every got a EINVAL at doConnect (net.js) error?  I'm assuming its when I connect to the Bitly api & get capped on the number calls I can make
[15:21] newy has joined the channel
[15:21] tmedema: Glenjamin: I actually tried that first. The reason I went with require is that the setter forces you to start with 1 indent like so: https://gist.github.com/1170910
[15:21] vipaca has joined the channel
[15:22] devrim: eazyigz_no idea
[15:22] eazyigz_: devrim: come on bro, you are the node.js expert!  Lol, just teasing man.
[15:23] tmedema: robinduckett: how do you think I have have these routines get settings from node-settings without being dependent on node-settings?

[15:23] tmedema: I would like to create a config.xml file
[15:23] Glenjamin: noooooo
[15:24] Glenjamin: yml or js (not json)
[15:24] dgathright has joined the channel
[15:24] robinduckett: yml is horrible
[15:24] robinduckett: as is json
[15:24] DrMcKay: xml? my eyes hurt.
[15:24] Glenjamin: agree on json, disagree on yml
[15:24] robinduckett: just let people return their own object
[15:24] robinduckett: which implements a .get and a .set
[15:24] nibblebo_: aheckmann: so 2.0 Model.update is $set by default and handles all the $ operators. only limitation is if you want to replace the whole doc?
[15:24] tmedema: robinduckett: hmm?
[15:24] brianc has joined the channel
[15:25] Glenjamin: tmedema: i think having a global/static mediator is worse than having an indent. If the pattern becomes common people can always choose to not indent init()
[15:25] hekkwan has joined the channel
[15:25] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[15:25] tmedema: Glenjamin: really? why is it so bad though?
[15:26] robinduckett: when you load the config, load a js file, but in that js file they can do anything as long as they module.exports a class instance or object with .get('whatever') and/or .set('whatever', 'newvalue');
[15:26] Glenjamin: agree with robinduckett  on the config thing
[15:26] garrensm_ has joined the channel
[15:26] robinduckett: that way
[15:26] robinduckett: you can do a config file which loads from xml, yml, json, brainfuck
[15:27] socialhack_ has left the channel
[15:27] Glenjamin: tmedema: mostly for testing purposes, but also means a routine would be portable across anything that can provide events
[15:27] Glenjamin: tmedema: for example, if someone chooses to subclass the main event emitter
[15:27] radiodario has joined the channel
[15:28] tmedema: robinduckett: right, but how should for example https://github.com/tommedema/ExpressArchTest/blob/master/src/routines/server/server.js get the port from config without being dependent on node-settings? I was thinking about doing something like mediator.emit('settings.getPort', function(port) {}); and then create a routine that does depend on node-settings and emits that event
[15:28] RORgasm has joined the channel
[15:28] robinduckett: tmedema: actually that sounds good
[15:28] robinduckett: you could use the event system as a kind of send/recieve for settings
[15:28] tmedema: robinduckett: aye, ok ;)
[15:29] tmedema: Glenjamin: hmm, I guess you are right.. just really hate the init function :(
[15:29] Glenjamin: sounds like it might be slow, why not just have one "settings" event
[15:29] hunterloftis: Anybody have any ideas wtf is going on here? https://gist.github.com/1170928
[15:29] tmedema: Glenjamin: hmm yeah, and then settings.port .. probably better

[15:46] tmedema: Glenjamin: now that I think of it, simply getting settings may not be smart. If a routine gettings settings, it would depend on the structure of the settings file. Eg. it'd do settings.server.port, which couples it to the environment.js file

[15:53] mrdoodles: pjacobs: http://pastebin.com/JiFYGzRJ

[16:43] Layke: Your verification that we discussed earlier to authorize/check the user. Do You have to send that token each time I emit from my client? Cause I'm not sure how I can identify which socket id to use unless I send it every time.
[16:43] micheil: Layke: what's up?
[16:43] DrMcKay: caolanm: Python uses that, IIRC
[16:43] micheil: no, every socket has an id
[16:44] robinduckett: when you recieve the event it will have a clientId
[16:44] caolanm: DrMcKay: ok, sounds good then
[16:44] DrMcKay: caolanm: no, Python uses setUpClass and tearDownClass
[16:44] robinduckett: @Layke
[16:44] DrMcKay: caolanm: but I think we may use group
[16:44] caolanm: well, close enough ;)
[16:44] micheil: when you send data, you know what socket_id has sent it, because the socket you received it on will belong to that socket_id

[16:52] devaholic: goosebone
[16:52] mrdoodles: i.e. <% include(anotherView.ejs) %> ?
[16:52] robinduckett: mrdoodles https://github.com/visionmedia/jade

[16:52] CoverSlide: mrdoodles: are you ralking about 'partials' ?
[16:52] robinduckett: sorry i saw views in express
[16:52] mrdoodles: yes
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: mrdoodles layouts are currently implied in express
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: so you dont do anything
[16:53] devaholic: its pretty simple mrdoodles, but i cant recall the exact name of the function
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: <%- body %> in layout.ejs
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: but yeah ejs/jade/any other all share partial() from express
[16:53] CoverSlide: all the little kids with the pumped up kicks better run
[16:53] devaholic: whats the one to include though tj?
[16:53] devaholic: its some inline js
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: ejs doesnt have one, you could write a helper though
[16:53] devaholic: im sure ive seen it
[16:54] mrdoodles: tjholowaychuk: no i have that, i understand partials but with ruby for example, i can specify a separate layout file. i.e., one for fronted one for admin/back
[16:54] tjholowaychuk: mrdoodles yeah you can do that too, view ways to do it
[16:54] tjholowaychuk: res.render('foo', { layout: 'name' })
[16:54] trevor: Glenjamin & caolanm: Thanks for pushing that fix through!
[16:54] tjholowaychuk: <% layout('name') %>

[16:55] Sembiance: mrdoodles: have you seen: http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/  ?
[16:55] CoverSlide: tjholowaychuk: there's a layout function exposed to views?
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: CoverSlide yup
[16:56] CoverSlide: sweet
[16:56] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/layout-control/views/page2.html
[16:56] CoverSlide: that's new to me
[16:56] mrdoodles: checking it out, but els is more my style
[16:56] robinduckett: Sembiance: that looks like smarty/dwoo ಠ_ಠ
[16:56] Layke: robinduckett,  when you say, "when you receive the event it will have a clientId", that clientId is unique to each individual socket connection? So in my server, I need to save all client Ids that a particular use is connected against. Since they will inevitable be browsing in multiple windows?
[16:56] mrdoodles: perfect tjholowaychuk 
[16:57] robinduckett: (that's a look of disapproval for y'all without utf8)
[16:57] robinduckett: Layke: indeed, you will need to marry multiple clientIds to one user
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: in 3.x i might remove some of that stuff, not sure how i feel yet haha. i like some aspects of having express handle/expose some of these things but there are arguments towards having the template engines handle all of it too
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: tough call, i like parts of both
[16:57] Layke: Awesome. Glad I figured that bit out :) 
[16:57] mikeal has joined the channel

[17:58] chjj: bnoordhuis: im not sure, ubuntu strikes me as less professional, less stable, more bloated
[17:58] Nuck: Not to mention you can never cover up the fact that it's just a fancy style for a bunch of command line shit
[17:58] bnoordhuis: chjj: i install from the mini iso, that's as bare bones as it gets
[17:59] eazyigz_: chjj: what is less 'stable' about Ubuntu?
[17:59] Nuck: You can't just wrap your core in a GUI, you need the GUI to be part of the core.
[17:59] bnoordhuis: chjj: probably installs even less than a default debian install
[17:59] chjj: bnoordhuis: isnt that roughly the same thing as the deb netisntall?
[17:59] Nuck: That's something that no Linux user will ever understand.

[18:03] Nuck: Hardware with similar specs is pretty expensive.
[18:04] DrMcKay: eazyigz_: it's possible

[18:05] eazyigz_: fubada: what kind of applications do you intend to create with node.js?
[18:05] bnoordhuis: fubada: there's a lot of free online resources, like learnboost
[18:05] fubada: eazyigz_: mainly focusing on nodejs mongo and express
[18:05] Nuck: It requires you to unlearn what you've been trained to think.

[18:06] Nuck: CoverSlide: Agreed.
[18:06] eazyigz_: fubada: learn node-mongodb-native and Mongoose libraries

[19:02] tmedema: SubStack: hey there, was wondering if you could tell me whether browserify can be used with normal javascript libraries without putting them in somekind of "compiler"
[19:03] chapel: tmedema: compiler?
[19:04] tmedema: chapel: yeah, to "browserify" them
[19:04] chapel: use script tags separately from browserify, or what?
[19:04] CoverSlide: how about ln -s script.js ../public/js/
[19:04] chapel: or have them work like they are in script tags, but inside the browserify bundle?
[19:04] CoverSlide: that way you don't need browserify
[19:04] tmedema: chapel: well isn't the point of browserify to not use those tags anymore? 
[19:04] chapel: just trying to clarify
[19:05] chapel: you want to use them without requiring them?
[19:05] achiu has joined the channel
[19:05] CoverSlide: the point of browserify is to be able to write your client-side scripts similair to how you would write your server-side scripts, with require, etc
[19:06] chapel: I know what the point of it is
[19:06] tmedema: chapel: no, I do want to require them
[19:06] chapel: Ive used it extensively
[19:06] chapel: okay
[19:06] dob_ has joined the channel
[19:06] chapel: just include them in the entry object
[19:06] chapel: and they will be treated as if you put them in a script tag
[19:07] tmedema: chapel: for example I would like to do var soundManager = require('../lib/soundManager2.js');
[19:07] chapel: oh
[19:07] hornairs: hey can npm told to install dev dependencies only for the current package and not the current package's dependencies?
[19:07] chapel: hrm, sorry
[19:07] chapel: do... not don't
[19:07] squeese has joined the channel
[19:07] chapel: if you want to require, umm by default browserify does that
[19:07] chapel: if you require that file, it will find the file, and require it
[19:07] tmedema: chapel: but can it be required? it's not made for browserify
[19:07] tmedema: it's not made for node either
[19:08] EyePulp: I'm gonna require YOUR FACE.
[19:08] tmedema: it does not return anything either
[19:08] chapel: you would have to wrap it in an export
[19:08] chapel: which is easy
[19:08] voodootikigod has joined the channel

[19:11] heavysixer has joined the channel
[19:11] Layke: When I install something with npm, and then require it, how does my project know where to go to require the files? Like if I am going to be hosting accross many servers, do can I just save my root project directory with the node_modules in? Or would I then have to npm install on the new servers too?
[19:14] AvianFlu: tbranyen: my favorite is the "existential crisis" error
[19:14] AvianFlu: ReferenceError: self is not defined.
[19:14] tbranyen: :)
[19:15] EyePulp: Layke: I can't recall if the current node defaults to looking for a local node_modules directory, but I think it does (someone please correct me on this)
[19:15] tbranyen: its in the docs, but it looks at current working directory for a node_modules
[19:15] tbranyen: works up the filesystem chain
[19:15] tbranyen: then defaults to the npm root -g
[19:16] EyePulp: Layke: if it does, then yeah, you can wrap up your project along with the node_modules directory and then just drop that on servers and run it.  require() will work the same
[19:16] Layke: Okay thanks. :) 
[19:16] EyePulp: Layke: you'll just need node on the destination boxes
[19:16] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[19:16] tmedema: chapel: you mentioned that there is also a way to make these scripts behave as if they were added as head tags?
[19:16] Layke: Yup, at least that is one less thing I need to worry about.
[19:16] Layke: Or like 12 less things rather.
[19:17] KingJamool has joined the channel
[19:17] EyePulp: Layke: I dunno though, I'd say installing node/npm on those boxes and then using a package.json file in your project to define dependencies is a better approach… Maybe.  there are benefits.
[19:17] chapel: tmedema: just include them in the entry array

[19:18] tmedema: chapel: hmm, can I set that inside my client-side javascript bootstrap file? I really don't like putting that client-side logic in my server side module
[19:18] EyePulp: Layke: if you have a non-identical box to deploy to hardware/OS version wise, I think doing it via npm assures any module builds will be done to the environment.
[19:18] chapel: not sure what you mean?
[19:19] Layke: Ah right okay. I didn't know I can do package,json
[19:19] Layke: Still new. 
[19:19] Layke: Any reference docs I should read for that?
[19:19] EyePulp: Layke:  I just started using one - makes my deployments a bit easier
[19:19] tmedema: chapel: I'd like to set the client-side libraries on the client-side (eg. in public/js/bootstrap.js) rather than in the module where I require browersify

[19:21] EyePulp: Layke: I believe there's an npm manage with details
[19:22] chapel: tmedema: still not grepping what you mean, you can have your client side libraries anywhere you want
[19:22] tmedema: chapel: yeah, but you said I have to put them all in the entry configuration object
[19:22] chapel: yeah
[19:22] chapel: you can include whatever files you want
[19:22] chapel: in any directory
[19:23] chapel: it doesn't take a directory, it takes files, relative or absolute
[19:23] tmedema: chapel: well that makes no sense to me, since  some libraries I want to include only when I start a certain app
[19:23] tmedema: chapel: I know ;) we're talking about something else here
[19:23] brolin has joined the channel
[19:23] EyePulp: er… Manpage

[19:24] kenperkins has joined the channel
[19:24] chapel: what do you mean, all applications
[19:24] chapel: are these separate processes?
[19:24] tmedema: chapel: lets say I have two pages. page1.html and page2.html. page1.html should load app1.js and page2.html load app2.js - only app1.js needs soundManager2.js
[19:24] EyePulp: Layke: npm help json
[19:24] tmedema: chapel: processes? No, we are talking about a browser here
[19:24] tmedema: see my previous example :)
[19:26] tmedema: so basically inside app1.js I would like to do something like load('../lib/soundManager2.js');
[19:26] CoverSlide: you can do two browserify targets, can't you?
[19:27] chapel: well
[19:27] chapel: you can precompile browserify files

[19:27] chapel: and include them
[19:27] tmedema: chapel: how would that help me?
[19:27] chapel: idk
[19:28] chapel: by default browserify doesn't have anything to handle multiple versions of your included file depending on view
[19:28] chapel: but you can do browserify middleware

[19:31] sechrist: tmedema: that is what I am thinking about right now
[19:32] tmedema: would be great if you could require a normal javascript file, which would then just run as if it was added to the head as a script tag
[19:32] chapel: umm you can
[19:32] chapel: in the entry option
[19:33] tmedema: chapel: yeah, but the entry option is defined on the server side
[19:33] tmedema: chapel: basically if you are working on a client-side module you would have to just "know" that the server is going to add those libraries
[19:34] tmedema: whereas if you could do require('../lib/someLib.js'); inside the client side module, you would know
[19:34] tmedema: would make more sense I believe

[19:47] chapel: SubStack: did a great job on it
[19:47] _sorensen_: on the browser its just 1 script tag to include
[19:47] tbranyen: chapel: not disputing that, i just think out of the like hundreds of web browsers
[19:47] tbranyen: that script tags work flawlessly on
[19:47] tbranyen: how well battle tested is browserify
[19:47] _sorensen_: the quirks to me are just the differences when you are 'requiring' the exports

[19:56] AvianFlu: so how does a given machine determine how many open files it takes before an EMFILE happens?
[20:00] context: avianflu: the OS limits open file count per process, there is default and it can be changed, per administrators instruction, or even the process itself can lower that limit

[20:09] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: what's going on?
[20:10] context: copying 50+ files at once is gonna do nothing but thrash the shit out of your disk
[20:10] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2925547 <- this
[20:10] AvianFlu: context: how so
[20:10] DrMcKay: holy buckets of fuck...
[20:10] CoverSlide: isn't there an advocacy group that handles this?
[20:10] admc has joined the channel
[20:10] context: avianflu: the disk can still only write one thing at a time...
[20:10] context: avianflu: so you move 50 files, the platter heads are thrashing around like a midget trying to swim
[20:11] DrMcKay: are this guys out of their fucking minds?
[20:11] AvianFlu: don't we get some concurrency win from libeio though?

[20:12] AvianFlu: so this is gonna lead to earlier physical disk failures, or is it gonna lead to bad data
[20:12] DrMcKay: context: there's some speedup in some cases
[20:12] context: coverslide: you still wanna be careful as to HOW MANY files you try moving at once
[20:12] context: if he is running out of fd's he is moving to many files at once.
[20:12] AvianFlu: I think a configurable concurrency limit is the best thing to do here, moving forward.
[20:13] context: avianflu: correct.

[20:41] mape: do you get errors when starting the app?
[20:41] nuby_on_nails: nope, not at all
[20:42] mape: it could possibly be that the boilerplate fetches socket.io through the uri of the site, and if that doesn't resolve on the server that breaks
[20:42] petrjanda has joined the channel
[20:42] matthijs has joined the channel

[20:46] mape: hmm never encountered that, or had an issue about it

[21:31] jesusabdullah: Oh, no, I love external services
[21:31] jesusabdullah: I meant adding ^^^>< to the end of my url
[21:31] mape: that seems poor, I'd just add a space
[21:31] mape: simple solution to a pita issue
[21:32] mape: should work well from irc msg parsing to html linkification
[21:32] nuby_on_nails: mape: two questions - why do socket disconnects itslef after.. i don't know, 15sec?
[21:32] d3x7r0: guys what do you suggest to parse xml to json?
[21:32] tbranyen: a handwritten parser
[21:32] mape: nuby_on_nails: hm I don't think that is any code I've added, might be socket.io, but that most likely means something is wrong
[21:33] mape: nuby_on_nails: might be the heartbeat from socket.io, but that means the client disconnected, should do that if things are working well
[21:33] CoverSlide: d3x7r0: or something not-javascript
[21:34] d3x7r0: CoverSlide: I'm querying an external source that only provides xml
[21:34] nuby_on_nails: the same thing happens on http://boilerplate.mape.me/ for me
[21:34] brianc: d3x7r0: I'd probably go with what tbranyen said
[21:34] mape: *shouldn't
[21:34] mape: nuby_on_nails: it dies after 15sec?
[21:34] brianc: mape.me. mape.me my friend.
[21:34] nuby_on_nails: the socket connection - yes
[21:34] mape: hmm, what browser are you using?
[21:35] rmcastil has joined the channel
[21:35] nibblebot: what is the correct way to kill the node process after using process.on('uncaughtException') to log the error? I'm doing process.exit(1) now, but I think it's causing weird behavior with cluster
[21:35] nuby_on_nails: Chrome Beta… 14.0… something
[21:35] mape: in any case that would be a socket.io bug, you should join #socket.io and let them know
[21:35] nuby_on_nails: it seems thats chromes fault
[21:35] nuby_on_nails: cause firefox works well
[21:35] mape: nuby_on_nails: might be the websocket spec changes, but if that was the issue you shouln't be able to connect at all
[21:36] robotmay has joined the channel
[21:36] mape: but yeah, let the socket.io people know, and they will probly know the solution/cause
[21:36] CoverSlide: the websocket spec changes force it to use xhr
[21:36] nuby_on_nails: ok, ill contact them
[21:36] mape: yeah, but then he shouldn't die after 15sec

[21:38] tmedema: So I've implemented Browserify. It seems excellent. However, how do I go about turning a client side js library that is quite complex into a requirable "module", eg. this one: https://github.com/scottschiller/SoundManager2/blob/master/script/soundmanager2.js

[21:39] mape: nuby_on_nails: the entire idea of the boilerplate is to get you started, not a full solution
[21:40] CoverSlide: tmedema: you have two options, use assetmanager to handle those libraries
[21:40] mape: feel free to remove/add/change and make it work for your project
[21:40] CoverSlide: tmedema: or modify them so they can export what you need

[23:31] fubada:  prints garbage instead of the contents of my buffer
[23:31] CoverSlide: fubada: buf.toString is a function
[23:31] harth has joined the channel
[23:31] CoverSlide: buf.toString() gets you the contents
[23:31] fubada: yea i meant that
[23:32] CoverSlide: how do you know that it isn't printing what's in your buffer?
[23:32] fubada: one sec
[23:33] fubada: CoverSlide: 
[23:33] fubada: http://pastebin.com/4uhL9vN1
[23:33] fubada: It should print 1..100
[23:33] fubada: instead I get that string on the very bottom

[23:34] CoverSlide: ..
[23:34] fubada: im just doing some tutorials, learning
[23:34] CoverSlide: are you sure you understand what 'binary' is
[23:34] Krm_ has joined the channel
[23:34] fubada: so bare with me if I pasted something very stupid
[23:36] CoverSlide: a buffer is binary data, each [i] is a binary byte
[23:36] langworthy has joined the channel
[23:36] fubada: right, so I'm doing a .toString right>?
[23:36] fubada: that should give the the utf8 string?
[23:36] CoverSlide: when you set buf[i] = 48, you don't get a string '48', you get the ascii value of the number 48
[23:37] fubada: right..
[23:37] fubada: heh
[23:37] fubada: sorry
[23:37] CoverSlide: so converted to string, it becomes the character '0'
[23:38] fubada: my exercise calls for: Create an uninitialized buffer with 100 bytes length and fill it with bytes with values starting from 0 to 99. And then print its contents
[23:38] CoverSlide: converting the whole buffer to strings becomes a long string with each byte converted to its character value
[23:38] fubada: right
[23:38] CoverSlide: well then I'd say you achieved this correctly
[23:39] fubada: so did I answer my exercize correctly?
[23:39] CoverSlide: yes
[23:39] fubada: thanks
[23:40] DrMcKay: ok, I've fixed that, but I won't get him here yet, he's running on my local server for now

[23:48] abjorn: pft all i did was make 34556 bullshit node projects
[23:48] abjorn: then went to one
[23:48] bartt has joined the channel
[23:48] sechrist: hi! What's your github? what cool modules have you written? Oh, ok. Why do you have ruby? Oh. I see.
[23:49] CoverSlide: c-hello-world
[23:49] DrMcKay: tjholowaychuk has the most npm packages, IIRC
[23:49] CoverSlide: more than substack?
[23:49] DrMcKay: CoverSlide: no, GNOME Keyring synchronization
[23:49] abjorn: a monopoly on npm packages
[23:49] sechrist: if the yardstick is # of github repos, go them 
[23:49] sechrist: :)
[23:49] abjorn: but nah i went to a node meetup here and almost no one there had actually used node before, it was just people interested in it so..no one really cared.

[23:51] sechrist: I miss texas, I moved to the valley about a year ago
[23:51] mikey_p: I was impressed at the portland JS meeup, quite a bit of talk about node last night
[23:51] abjorn: You wouldn't be missing it if you knew how hot it's been.
[23:51] DrMcKay: well, in Poland we actually have quite good community
[23:51] sechrist: yeah I've seen the temps

[23:52] raidfive has joined the channel
[23:52] sechrist: I'd rather not have to deal with the US

[23:52] CoverSlide: ha! subby has 65 packages, tj only has a measly +
[23:52] CoverSlide: 63
[23:52] abjorn: measly
[23:52] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: so, i'm using this:   express.logger({ format: 'PORTAL REQUEST :status [:date] :method :url' }),
[23:52] sechrist: snap
[23:52] sechrist: turtle is beating a ferret
[23:52] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: does express.logger have a way to filter stuff out?

[23:53] sechrist: also if I leave the US
[23:53] sechrist: I can get bandwidth for so much cheaper
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: isaacs you can pass a function to logger() to return a string that is your log line
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: or
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: var logger = logger(options);
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: and wrap it in a different middleware
[23:53] abjorn: aw snap time for a game of LoL
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: then it will just act like a callback basically
[23:53] isaacs: hm, i see.
