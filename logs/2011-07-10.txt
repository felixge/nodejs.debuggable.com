[01:02] emacsen: I need to make seven (somewhat unrelated) async calls in order to do some processing. Does that basically mean I need to code functions 7 layers deep?
[01:02] VeXii: and do you know if expressjs got the same problem? :p
[01:02] seawise has joined the channel
[01:03] blkcat: emacsen: or you can look into a library like async.js
[01:03] blkcat: emacsen: async.series( [ func1, func2, func3 ] )
[01:03] emacsen: blkcat, that sounds like step
[01:04] emacsen: and the problem with step is that it passes the data from func1 to func2
[01:04] blkcat: async.series does not.
[01:04] emacsen: blkcat, here's the code as it would be in python, without async calls

[01:21] Nexxy: lots of string replace!
[01:21] deoxxa: random123: just something to think about, node.js isn't really that well suited to serving static files. i run nginx in front of node for pretty much all my http tasks to help alleviate some of that stress.
[01:24] random123: vexii: I use multiline variables to capture html, I really don't like the templating options avaliable
[01:25] VeXii: true but sesly that sounds like it gets a mess fast
[01:26] random123: vexii: So you write buffer = ""; and put the html in there, and use \ to make them multiline

[01:28] Aria: I mean kernel level sendfile.
[01:28] Aria: sendfile(2)
[01:29] Aria: That eliminates user-space buffering, which is most of the difference between what node does and nginx does by default.

[01:40] creationix: sdl has a really easy joystick API
[01:40] Nexxy: neat!
[01:40] creationix: I haven't made it event based yet, but polling the joysticks in a setInterval works great
[01:41] creationix: not sure if event based would help for joysticks anyway, they are often quite noisy and polling is sometimes best
[01:41] creationix: I'll need events for mouse and keyboard input though
[01:41] Nexxy: I would think polling would be better suited
[01:41] Nexxy: but I've never really done much with them
[01:41] creationix: and button events on the joystick

[01:57] isaacs: VeXii: i recommend reading through `man bash`
[01:57] isaacs: VeXii: it touches on most of the core concepts.

[02:01] creationix: isaacs: what's going to be the story for native addons in windows?
[02:01] creationix: will npm support pre-built binaries?
[02:02] isaacs: creationix: npm already supports pre-built binaries
[02:02] isaacs: creationix: but building them appropriately is hard :)
[02:02] isaacs: SubStack: `man bash` is how i learned most of what i know about bash.  also, asking questions (and getting made fun of for it) in #bash
[02:02] isaacs: the people in #bash are very mean.
[02:03] isaacs: but they do know bash.
[02:03] creationix: isaacs: so how would I include addons in my node-sdl package?
[02:03] creationix: I have builds for node 4 on arm and i386
[02:03] isaacs: creationix: it'd still be the same require() semantics
[02:03] isaacs: creationix: oh, you mean, how do you publish built addons?
[02:04] creationix: isaacs: right
[02:04] creationix: for more than one target platform
[02:04] VeXii: uhh ofc the #bash >-<
[02:04] isaacs: creationix: there's no facility right now for uploading from platform X for platform Y
[02:05] isaacs: creationix: but if you `npm config set bin-publish true` and then do an `npm publish` from that platform, it'll upload a built binary package that can be installed for that platform
[02:05] creationix: isaacs: ok, so that's not so bad
[02:05] isaacs: well, it sucks if you're building it for a phone :)
[02:05] isaacs: creationix: since it means you have to compile and publish it from said phone
[02:05] isaacs: instead of cross-compiliint
[02:05] isaacs: *g
[02:06] creationix: isaacs: I don't cross-compile on webos, I build on my touchpad
[02:06] creationix: it's plenty fast for node stuff
[02:06] isaacs: creationix: kewl
[02:07] creationix: ok, I just published the "sdl" module from i386 linux, now can people get the pre-built binary?
[02:07] isaacs: creationix: if you want more nuts-and-bolts, the data structure looks like  "dist": { "tarball" : <the unbuilt tarball>, sha: <the sha hash>,  "bin" : { <platform> : { tarball, sha } } }
[02:08] isaacs: creationix: like this: http://registry.npmjs.org/srand/1.0.1
[02:08] isaacs: creationix: the platform is `npm get bindist`
[02:09] creationix: nice http://registry.npmjs.org/sdl/0.0.1
[02:09] creationix: looks like I have a linux entry
[02:09] isaacs: creationix: originally it was just nodeversion-platform-platformversion, but that doesn't work.  cpu arch will be included once node exposes it (0.6, that means)
[02:09] isaacs: yep :)
[02:09] isaacs: you can also set the "bindist" field explicitly, if you want to manage your own family of binary package releases.
[02:10] isaacs: creationix: then you could do `npm install sdl --bindist creationix` or something
[02:10] creationix: I see
[02:10] creationix: I'll have to dig more into this later, have to run pretty soon
[02:10] isaacs: i experimented with going through and seeing what builds where, but it's really hard to make that all not suck.
[02:10] isaacs: kewl, have fun :)

[03:33] iamanewb: Hello all...I have a new question about socket.io and http-proxy.  I'd like to have Node.js proxy all non-socket.io requests to another server (i.e., Apache/PHP), while everything socket.io-related gets handled normally.
[03:33] iamanewb: I'm more-or-less able to do this, except I'm missing something, and socket.io falls-back onto htmlfile, instead of websocket
[03:34] sivy has joined the channel
[03:34] iamanewb: What I'm doing is if the incoming connection has /socket.io in the url, I do not redirect, but everything else gets proxied to the apache service.
[03:34] iamanewb: I think the websocket connection does not have anything in the URL, or is not being caught for some reason.

[03:47] iamanewb: ok...nevermind, I'm just going a bit crazy with different browsers.  Is chrome the only one that currently supports websockets?
[03:47] kbni: I think firefox5 does?
[03:48] dguttman has joined the channel
[03:48] deoxxa: only if it's enabled specifically
[03:48] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[03:50] iamanewb: So it looks like Firefox (by default) does xhr-polling, IE8 resorts to 'htmlfile', and chrome does websockets.  Presumably websockets is best...why doesn't IE use xhr-polling?
[03:51] iamanewb: XHR is a native object there...isn't it?
[03:52] tbranyen: iamanewb: no
[03:52] Aria: Different cross-domain policies?
[03:52] iamanewb: cross-domain shouldn't come into play

[03:53] hermanjunge: Does anybody knows the way to list the functions of an object?
[03:53] tbranyen: iamanewb: ah crap i was thinking of addEventListener
[03:53] tbranyen: hermanjunge: that does list them
[03:53] systemfault: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) IIRC
[03:53] hermanjunge: not after a new
[03:53] tbranyen: v8: var myObj = { myFunc: function(){} }; Object.keys(myObj);
[03:53] v8bot: tbranyen: ["myFunc"]
[03:53] tbranyen: hermanjunge: thats not functions, thats a prototype chain
[03:53] tbranyen: er properties*
[03:53] systemfault: v8: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Array);
[03:53] v8bot: systemfault: ["arguments","length","isArray","name","prototype","caller"]
[03:54] tbranyen: hermanjunge: just look at the prototype object?
[03:54] hermanjunge: Object.getOwnPropertyNames didn't do the trick
[03:54] hermanjunge: inheritance is a bitch!
[03:54] tbranyen: its not going to
[03:54] hermanjunge: A spend the whole afternoon and learn A LOT
[03:54] tbranyen: you can use the nonstandard __proto__
[03:55] hermanjunge: I have an OOP Background, but I'm getting use to this quickly
[03:55] hermanjunge: __proto__?
[03:55] tbranyen: v8> function c() {} c.prototype.d=function(){}; Object.keys(new c().__proto__)
[03:55] v8bot: tbranyen: ["d"]
[03:55] hermanjunge: what does it?
[03:55] hermanjunge: let me try it
[03:55] tbranyen: v8> function c() {} c.prototype.d=function(){}; Object.keys(new c().getPrototypeOf())
[03:55] v8bot: tbranyen: TypeError: Object #<c> has no method 'getPrototypeOf'
[03:55] systemfault: Ahh.. that's our tbranyen, encouraging people to use non-standard stuff..
[03:55] tbranyen: hmm
[03:56] hermanjunge: non standard stuff rules
[03:56] tbranyen: yeah and it appears the standard isn't in v8
[03:56] tbranyen: heh
[03:56] tbranyen: oh wait
[03:56] tbranyen: v8> function c() {} c.prototype.d=function(){}; Object.keys(Object.getPrototypeOf(new c()))
[03:56] v8bot: tbranyen: ["d"]
[03:56] tbranyen: there we go
[03:56] systemfault: Heh...
[03:57] tbranyen: hermanjunge: use Object.getPrototypeOf since thats standard :)
[03:57] hermanjunge: :)
[03:57] hermanjunge: before going. What is exactly __proto__?
[03:57] tbranyen: the current prototype of the instane
[03:57] hermanjunge: ok
[03:57] tbranyen: v8> var obj = {}; obj.__proto__ = { lol: 'hi' }; obj.lol
[03:57] v8bot: tbranyen: "hi"
[03:58] hermanjunge: I did an ugly hack to inheritate from an object, and then to inherit its this.*
[03:58] iamanewb: Ok...so it seems if I serve an html file from apache (port 80) that calls node.js/socket.io (from port 8080), IE8 will use xhr-polling.
[03:58] hermanjunge: you can call them "its privates"
[03:58] hermanjunge: using proto
[03:58] hermanjunge: but did understand exactly what I did
[03:58] hermanjunge: ok
[03:58] iamanewb: If I serve that same file by proxying apache through Node.js on the same port as socket.io/node.js, IE8 use htmlfile.
[03:58] hermanjunge: Thanks a LOT!

[05:16] deoxxa: what's the best way to defer execution of a program until resources have been allocated (database handles, network connections, etc)?
[05:19] Jakwac: Use a callback?
[05:20] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[05:20] deoxxa: Jakwac: i considered that, but i have a case where there's multiple database connections and other resources that need to be available before the rest of the application can function, and i can't be sure that they'll all be ready at the same time or in a specific order
[05:20] deoxxa: also i'd like to have them allocated in parallel, not one after the other
[05:20] Jakwac: Increment a value
[05:20] Jakwac: on each call to your resources
[05:20] Jakwac: Then decrement it in each callback
[05:21] deoxxa: i'm not sure i follow
[05:21] Nexxy: deoxxa, async.js?
[05:21] Jakwac: Along with each callback call a funciton to start your app. In the beginining of that function check the value of the variable you've been incrementing
[05:21] deoxxa: ah, and busy wait on that variable until it's the right value?
[05:22] deoxxa: Nexxy: hmm yeah, i'm using that for another project, it might fit
[05:22] Nexxy: I would just use parallel and then wait for the final cb
[05:22] Nexxy: to "init" the rest of the app
[05:22] deoxxa: oh, that works perfectly
[05:22] deoxxa: async it is!
[05:23] deoxxa: in other news, i just published my first npm packages :D

[05:41] rurufufuss: just checking node.js today, it seems like some sort of holy grail of webdev
[05:41] rurufufuss: high traffic
[05:41] patrikkarlin has joined the channel
[05:41] rurufufuss: wouldn't mind a complex example too
[05:41] Prometheus: well, there's https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Projects,-Applications,-and-Companies-Using-Node
[05:41] Prometheus: though that's just a list..
[05:42] rurufufuss: also, I was trying to run the example at nodejs.org
[05:43] rurufufuss: but accidentally did "sudo apt-get install node"
[05:43] rurufufuss: which installed some unrelated node software
[05:43] rurufufuss: then I installed node from github
[05:43] rurufufuss: how do I run "node example.js" now?
[05:43] Jakwac: does node -v return anything?
[05:44] rurufufuss: returns "axconfig: port 1 not active"
[05:44] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[05:44] Jakwac: ah, you might try running a `sudo apt-get remove node`
[05:44] rurufufuss: yeah just did
[05:44] rurufufuss: and reinstall the node package from github I imagine?
[05:44] butu5 has joined the channel
[05:45] Jakwac: Well as long as its run your path you should be fine
[05:45] patrikkarlin: yea compile it
[05:45] rurufufuss: where is it generally located on linux?
[05:45] Jakwac: depends where you install
[05:45] rurufufuss: just did sudo make install
[05:45] Jakwac: Not sure of the default prefix though
[05:47] rurufufuss: ah it just made the library on the folder
[05:47] rurufufuss: works now

[05:48] Jakwac: That the same thing as rvm?
[05:48] Jakwac: but for node
[05:48] sw8sw8 has joined the channel
[05:48] brainproxy: Jakwac: similar idea, yes
[05:48] rurufufuss: cool, will check that out
[05:48] brainproxy: installs npm for you too
[05:48] jacobolus has joined the channel
[05:48] brainproxy: then you can do things like
[05:48] harth_ has joined the channel
[05:49] brainproxy: nvm use v0.4.9
[05:49] brainproxy: well first, nvm install v0.4.9
[05:49] brainproxy: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[05:50] Prometheus: for some reason, I read that as vim
[05:51] sivy has joined the channel
[05:51] rurufufuss: so nvm is basically an updater for node.js
[05:51] srid has joined the channel
[05:51] brainproxy: well it lets you install and switch between versions of node
[05:51] brainproxy: and w/ each installed version, npm is installed alongside it
[05:51] rurufufuss: sweet, I just have to run it as root eh?
[05:51] mykul has joined the channel
[05:51] brainproxy: no, it's meant to be run as a normal linux user
[05:52] brainproxy: it installs the versions under ~/.nvm
[05:53] brainproxy: per the instructions on the its github page, you'll want to source nvm.sh via ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
[05:53] brainproxy: that way you're ready to rock as soon as you open a terminal or login over ssh
[05:53] rurufufuss: ah right ic
[05:53] rurufufuss: I better RTFM
[05:54] rurufufuss: actually, I was coming here to ask a different question than setups
[05:54] rurufufuss: any reasons not to use node.js?
[05:54] Nexxy: are you a square?
[05:54] Nexxy: that's a good reason
[05:54] rurufufuss: haha
[05:54] Jakwac: Depends what your doing with it
[05:54] brainproxy: rurufufuss: if you don't like programming in javascript, that might be a reason
[05:54] rurufufuss: well, I'm just trying to compare different frameworks
[05:55] Nexxy: node > *
[05:55] brainproxy: rurufufuss: out of the box, node is pretty low level stuff
[05:55] Jakwac: Node isnt a firework for one
[05:55] rurufufuss: I used to do a lot of actionscripting
[05:55] brainproxy: you're not getting mvc formalism like with rails
[05:55] Nexxy: that's what express is for!
[05:55] rurufufuss: yeah, that wont come for free I guess
[05:55] rurufufuss: what does express do?
[05:55] brainproxy: if you want a framework you can get those via npm
[05:55] Nexxy: "sudo npm install express"
[05:55] Jakwac: There are tons out there though
[05:55] Nexxy: now you have MVC
[05:55] rurufufuss: arg, can't find package express
[05:55] Prometheus: what are noders called?
[05:56] brainproxy: with nvm, you wouldn't need sudo
[05:56] stagas has joined the channel
[05:56] brainproxy: just npm install ...
[05:56] rurufufuss: fair enough
[05:56] brainproxy: rurufufuss: http://search.npmjs.org/#/express
[05:56] rurufufuss: what about database connections? what DBs go with node.js?
[05:56] harth_ has joined the channel
[05:56] Prometheus: rurufufuss: any
[05:56] Nexxy: unless things have changed again, isaacs suggested using sudo with the install command as it deescalates user permissions?
[05:57] isaacs: Nexxy: things have not changed.
[05:57] brainproxy: Nexxy: ah, maybe so, not sure if that's apropo if one is using nvm
[05:57] Nexxy: yay!
[05:57] brainproxy: isaacs: rule still applies to nvm users?
[05:57] isaacs: brainproxy: using sudo is ok, but not usually required.
[05:58] isaacs: brainproxy: security-wise, it's better, but security-wise, it's best to not install anything you don't trust anyhow
[05:58] Nexxy: so much for windows 7
[05:58] brainproxy: isaacs: I read all the npm docs today, first time to read all the way through; great job :) it's all pretty clear once you've got your head in the right place
[05:59] isaacs: brainproxy: wow!
[05:59] isaacs: brainproxy: i haven't read those things all the way through in a long time.
[05:59] brainproxy: isaacs: in any case, just appreciative of how well it's all put together and inspired to docuemtn and organize as efficiently as yourself
[06:00] brainproxy: not brown-nosing, just letting you know your hard work is appreciated
[06:00] Nexxy: ACTION hands brainproxy a wet nap
[06:00] isaacs: thanks, that's great to hear :)
[06:00] isaacs: it's a survival mechanism :)
[06:00] Nexxy: no but srsly tho, npm *is* pretty awesome
[06:00] isaacs: i forget how it works a lot of the time.

[06:04] rurufufuss: gracias muchas
[06:04] Prometheus: =)
[06:04] rurufufuss: actually, not sure if thats the right phrase
[06:04] Prometheus: and yeah, nodetuts are good for getting a bit of a feel of node
[06:04] brainproxy: rurufufuss: one thing to consider doing, if you really want to get your head around what node provides to you at the most basic level is to sim all the way through the API
[06:04] Prometheus: muchos gracias
[06:04] brainproxy: *skim
[06:04] rurufufuss: I'll try doing that
[06:04] brainproxy: that will give you a sense of the building blocks on top of which everything else is built
[06:05] Prometheus: brainproxy: but given the vast number of modules on NPM, that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what's already there =)
[06:05] Prometheus: well, it does, but..
[06:05] Jakwac: Ryan has given some good talks, one of them is on the nodejs page
[06:05] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:05] brainproxy: Prometheus: well, i mean in terms of the facilities that node is actually providing
[06:05] Prometheus: right, but the modules are worth taking in to account as well
[06:05] Prometheus: I think
[06:05] brainproxy: yes, they are, most certainly
[06:06] Prometheus: though just about any language/platform will offer you similar tools, but..
[06:06] isaacs: ACTION remembers when the code WAS the documentation
[06:06] rurufufuss: until yesterday I was writing a web server with c++ and fastcgi
[06:06] rurufufuss: all these modern webdev stuff is scaring me
[06:06] Prometheus: rurufufuss: are you scared of productivity too? =)
[06:06] brainproxy: rurufufuss: sounds paintufl
[06:07] rurufufuss: well I'm taking a break from my usual non-webdev c++ stuff
[06:07] rurufufuss: yes it is
[06:07] pquerna: rurufufuss: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzp4MJRKHc&feature=related
[06:07] rurufufuss: but after years and years of c++ jumping to javascript makes me feel like an old guy joining a group dating club
[06:07] Prometheus: rurufufuss: what would your web server do, just serve pages?
[06:08] rurufufuss: was playin around with paypal IPN
[06:08] Prometheus: so you wrote a web server in C++ for that? :o
[06:08] Prometheus: or was that the fastcgi part.. =P
[06:08] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[06:08] Prometheus: just wondering, why you would want to be writing your own server in C++ :)
[06:09] Prometheus: either way, I think you are in the right place now 
[06:09] rurufufuss: since I'm using nginx and fcgi, I don't know if you could say I'm writing my own web server
[06:09] Prometheus: oh.. I was going to say, why not use nginx =P
[06:09] rurufufuss: I suppose more like a web app in c++? :p
[06:09] rurufufuss: yeah whoops, I better rephrase that
[06:09] Prometheus: writing a web app in C++, sounds painful
[06:09] Prometheus: like, immensely painful
[06:09] rurufufuss: hahahaha
[06:09] rurufufuss: trying to get sendmail working from it was a nightmare
[06:10] brainproxy: Prometheus: I've got a friend who swears by it
[06:10] rurufufuss: for webdev?
[06:10] Prometheus: brainproxy: really?
[06:10] isaacs: brainproxy: friends don't let friends swear by c++
[06:10] rurufufuss: or for application developments?
[06:10] brainproxy: Prometheus: yeah, but he's always been a little crazy :D
[06:10] systemfault: Sometimes, C++ is the answer :P
[06:10] Prometheus: brainproxy: I don't think a little even begins to describe it.. =P
[06:10] rurufufuss: you see, picking up javascript for c++ is like telling a jedi to use a blaster
[06:10] isaacs: if c++ is the answer, someone asked the wrong question.
[06:11] systemfault: But for web.. it's pretty much never the answer.
[06:11] herbySk has joined the channel
[06:11] systemfault: isaacs: **cough**V8**cough**
[06:11] isaacs: systemfault: yeah... v8 is probably the least awful c++ program i've ever dealt with.
[06:11] Prometheus: rurufufuss: interestingly enough, I read an article somewhere (perhaps it was those hueniverse articles) where the guy is/was a C(++?) programmer, and he said it felt like home ;)
[06:11] Prometheus: minus the callbacks, of course
[06:11] isaacs: and i mean, those guys *clearly* know what they're doing of course.
[06:11] brainproxy: he's using some thing that generates c++ from javascript, so he can write the client and server logic in c++
[06:12] rurufufuss: oh nice
[06:12] brainproxy: sorry, other way around
[06:12] Prometheus: wait what, parsing javascript to C++?
[06:12] brainproxy: I mean it generates javascript from c++
[06:12] Prometheus: oh
[06:12] rurufufuss: c++ in client??
[06:13] Prometheus: I don't know if that really makes more sense, but I guess a little :)
[06:13] brainproxy: well the client side logic in c++ spits out javascript which is actually served up to the browser-clients
[06:13] rurufufuss: hmm
[06:14] deoxxa: that sounds frightening
[06:14] rurufufuss: I thought c++ parsers are super hard to make
[06:14] brainproxy: people have done things like that with ocaml
[06:14] rurufufuss: to make something that converts c++ -> javascript??
[06:14] brainproxy: talk about some crazy looking javascript
[06:14] Prometheus: talk about some crazy people
[06:14] rurufufuss: ahem
[06:14] Prometheus: :P
[06:14] rurufufuss: so is it possible to connect c++ to node.js, in any way?
[06:14] rurufufuss: like, say, if I feel like using c++ :P
[06:15] rurufufuss: despite better advices
[06:15] brainproxy: example:  http://jaked.github.com/froc/examples/froc-dom/follow-the-mouse/follow.js
[06:15] brainproxy: that's an ocaml program which got run through ocamljs

[08:16] quintin: but when i do a  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh 
[08:17] quintin: i get
[08:17] quintin: npm cannot be installed without nodejs. Install node first, and then try again.  Maybe node is installed, but not in the PATH? Note that running as sudo can change envs.  PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin 
[08:17] quintin: can someone help?
[08:17] context: if you have sudo why not install node to /usr/local ?
[08:17] context: and node needs to be in your path for npm to find it.
[08:18] quintin: i did a echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile source ~/.profile
[08:18] Nuck: Is it possible to shard a folder among multiple servers?
[08:18] Nuck: Or do I need to use subfolders to shard
[08:18] context: but thats not where node is
[08:18] quintin: but which node gave me
[08:18] quintin: echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile source ~/.profile
[08:18] context: and if you are gonna install it to your home remove the sudo from the command
[08:18] quintin: sorry
[08:19] quintin: which node ~/node/bin/node
[08:19] context: quintin: you just said node was installed at ~/node/bin not ~/local/node/bin
[08:19] quintin: yes yes
[08:19] context: $HOME/local/node/bin != $HOME/node/bin
[08:20] quintin: hmmm
[08:20] context: quintin: curl the://url | sh
[08:20] quintin: you are righr
[08:20] context: remove the sudo.
[08:20] quintin: you are right
[08:20] quintin: @context, do u suggest installing to /home
[08:20] quintin: or to /usr/local?
[08:20] k0ral has joined the channel
[08:20] context: /usr/local if you can.
[08:20] quintin: ok
[08:21] quintin: a ./configure without anyparams

[08:22] quintin: didnt find anything
[08:22] quintin: if i dont a ./configure;make;make install
[08:23] quintin: *do
[08:23] context: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=nodejs&project=home%3ASannisDev

[08:46] fille: me
[08:46] EM03: the web framework
[08:47] EM03: do you?
[08:47] fille: nod
[08:47] EM03: do you like it?
[08:47] EM03: what do you think of it?
[08:47] fille: well u got totall controll of everything
[08:47] fille: thats the nice part of it
[08:48] fille: anyone using mongoose here?
[08:48] craigbarnes: Nuck: That's not a job for application level code
[08:49] EM03: so what do you think of it fille , ever use rails?
[08:49] craigbarnes: You can rate limit with iptables
[08:49] fille: EM03  its not like django 
[08:49] EM03: would you rather use that or django?
[08:49] fille: EM03 i rather use express.js easy deployment, alot of templates styles
[08:49] Nexxy: ACTION cringes @ the thought of rails
[08:49] EM03: I use rails right now 
[08:50] vhold: fille: I played with it for the first time today..  I got the Chirp example at http://www.ivarvong.com/2010/08/05/node-js-connect-mongoose-and-underscore/ to work with some changes.. but I think I like mongodb-wrapper more...
[08:50] Nexxy: I'm sorry.
[08:50] EM03: how is form handling?
[08:50] EM03: rails is complex and long 
[08:50] Nexxy: EM03, https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
[08:50] fille: EM03 very easy
[08:50] fille: thanks vhold
[08:50] EM03: easier than rails?
[08:50] Nexxy: and less, "WHOOPS!"
[08:51] EM03: hmmm
[08:51] seyz has joined the channel
[08:51] vhold: the main reason I like mongodb-wrapper more is that I have been playing with mongodb for a couple weeks and have become relatively familiar with the shell, and mongodb-wrapper tries to leverage that 
[08:51] EM03: this could be life changing
[08:51] fille: app.post("/remove",function(req,res)) { res.body.id  }

[08:52] fille: hrm.. okej vhold i will look in to it
[08:53] fille: or i just use mysql.. :D
[08:54] Nuck: craigbarnes: Why is it not application-level?  I intend to throttle API usage and log anything above that so I can monitor the attempts at abuse and tie them to usernames and such :D
[08:54] Nuck: fille: Ewwwwww
[08:54] Nuck: fille: Trust me, Mongodb is better
[08:55] fille: Nuck think about using both
[08:55] Nuck: fille: That's completely and utterly ridiculous.
[08:55] EM03: fille: where you located?
[08:55] m00p has joined the channel
[08:55] Nexxy: why is it ridiculous to use sql and mongo?
[08:56] Nexxy: that's like saying it's ridiculous to use a hammer and a screwdriver
[08:56] Nexxy: instead of just one or the other
[08:56] fille: the plan is to start use mongo db to my autocomplete ajax fields
[08:56] Nuck: Nexxy: Because MySQL is slower and honestly, most use-cases that MongoDB is worse for, it makes up for by being still damn good.
[08:57] Nuck: fille: What do you need MySQL for?
[08:57] fille: i can really just change the question

[09:00] Nuck: It made my family not suck at organization!
[09:00] fille: yes but the  fucking with your head
[09:00] vhold: are you talking about the maze aspect of the stores ?
[09:00] fille: reading the manuell 
[09:01] Nuck: fille: The manual is actually better for me than a textual one.
[09:01] vhold: You'd think by now they'd get on the internet bandwagon and make videos of the asembly
[09:01] Nuck: As for the maze of the store, I just go with the flow and follow the arrows :P
[09:01] fille: hehehe, User friendly
[09:02] vhold: apparently there are shortcuts all over the store you can use to bypass the maze
[09:02] vhold: secretish doors
[09:02] Nuck: vhold: lol that'd be nice, but they can't get that wierd airguitar guy into a video easily.
[09:02] fille: yes, i there is, gooing to the biggest in the world

[09:37] jesusabdullah: Maybe "all new web apps" is too lofty
[09:37] Nuck: EM03: I like `3rdEden's idea.
[09:37] jesusabdullah: Why not suggest trying express for a project or two
[09:37] jesusabdullah: and when those go well, push for moar express
[09:37] Nuck: jesusabdullah: That's probably the best method.
[09:37] jesusabdullah: Probably
[09:37] EM03: all the projects are very large

[09:40] `3rdEden: but I'm never ever ever going back to that
[09:40] Nuck: EM03: I would too.  Probably because I'd be canned soon enough anyways, since I don't know Ruby :P
[09:41] jesusabdullah: Yeah, me too
[09:41] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I mean, Node's module systems have ended up almost perfect, and the way EventEmitters work.  Even things which are counterintuitive actually end up coming in handy when you use it for a major project.
[09:42] Nuck: ry must've had some CRAZY foresight.
[09:42] Nuck: I mean, the decision to not support multiple processors
[09:42] Nuck: SEEMS loony.
[09:42] Nuck: But it actually ends up being more scalable in the long run.
[09:43] EM03: `3rdEden: what did you think of it?
[09:43] `3rdEden: EM03 of what? rails?
[09:43] Nuck: OMG AWESOME. https://github.com/danlucraft/git.js
[09:43] EM03: yea
[09:43] `3rdEden: a bloated peice of shit
[09:43] EM03: how extensive did you use it?

[14:32] framlin: but for me working directly at the DOM using jQuery and jsdom and weld is much mor preferable tha using any templation-language with messing control-statments between the markup
[14:33] zoid9383: tuhoojabotti: yep, but breaking markup a la <div #foo#>bar</bar> is not any better than dom, and weld seems to be an interesting tool to reduce tedium

[15:33] Bartzy: Node.js is not intended to serve static files, right ?
[15:33] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[15:33] SubStack: Bartzy: you can serve static files
[15:33] bnoordhuis: Bartzy: not specifically but it can
[15:33] SubStack: I do it all the time
[15:34] SubStack: it's as easy as app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/static'))
[15:34] Bartzy: What I need to do is put nginx in front , answering all requests to my domain, and proxying requests to files that doesn't exist ?
[15:35] jetienne_: in qunit, is there something to like noraise() ? i have seen raise() but not noraise
[15:36] jetienne_: Bartzy: google you will have thousand of answer. and btw this is nginx stuff not node ones :)
[15:36] jetienne_: btw does node have sendfile() ?
[15:37] EM03: how does express compare to other languages of a framework of similar size?
[15:37] EM03: how if form handling? and sessions

[15:41] _aron has joined the channel
[15:41] bnoordhuis: jetienne_: it's fs.sendfile() but it's not documented
[15:42] jetienne_: ah
[15:43] jetienne_: bnoordhuis: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js#L363 thanks
[15:43] bnoordhuis: jetienne_: it follows regular sendfile(2) semantics though, just add a callback as the last argument
[15:43] bnoordhuis: jetienne_: yep, that's the one :)
[15:43] jetienne_: bnoordhuis: any reason not to doc it ?
[15:44] bnoordhuis: jetienne_: i think it's mainly because sendfile isn't very portable
[15:44] jetienne_: hmm ok
[15:44] EM03: hmmmm . bllllah
[15:45] jetienne_: EM03: search for such comparison on the web, it is better suitter than irc
[15:45] jetienne_: suitted
[15:45] EM03: i did google quite a bit hmm I think I might just go for it 
[15:46] EM03: I work on very large projects so sometimes if a bad framework is used we all suffer
[15:46] jetienne_: EM03: the point is more in the language you use for the server
[15:46] EM03: we do rails and we are miserable 
[15:47] EM03: rails gets huge and bloated quick 
[15:47] jetienne_: EM03: if you use node.js on the server, express.js is used a lot

[15:52] EM03: jetienne_: rails is killing us 
[15:52] Aikar: EM03: stab it back
[15:52] SubStack: Bartzy: use whatever is easy and does the job!

[15:53] Bartzy: SubStack: I can serve static files from PHP for example. But that's extremely stupid. My question is what are the general and best practice deployments of node.js in websites. Behind some web server ?
[15:54] SubStack: Bartzy: you haven't given us enough information to make an informed response
[15:54] SubStack: are you serving up gigabytes of data each day? best to use nginx then
[15:54] hippich has joined the channel
[15:54] SubStack: are you just serving a few static files? node works just fine for that

[15:54] hippich has joined the channel

[15:55] EM03: this is just for new stuff
[15:55] jetienne_: EM03: you got the time to estimate the alternative
[15:55] Bartzy: Node.js is generally used only for high-tarffic apps ?
[15:55] Bartzy: or also for regular websites ?
[15:55] EM03: express with some templates seems to be a good way of doing it

[15:56] blkcat: Bartzy: i think you're creating artificial distinctions here :)
[15:56] blkcat: Bartzy: you can use node for whatever you want.
[15:56] blkcat: i run my personal website on node just because i can. ;)
[15:56] jetienne_: blkcat: ++
[15:57] jetienne_: Bartzy: to bench static file in node is like 3 cmdline :)
[15:57] jetienne_: Bartzy: 1. create the apps. 2. run the app.js 3. do ab
[15:57] jetienne_: Bartzy: im not kidding :)
[15:57] Bartzy: SubStack: So with node you open the static files and serve them ?
[15:58] jetienne_: Bartzy: yes
[15:58] SubStack: Bartzy: you can use one of the many static modules on npm
[15:58] SubStack: some of them have caching even
[15:58] jetienne_: caching static file im not sure it is smart :)\
[15:59] Bartzy: I don't get why use node.js when you don't need high concurrency ?

[16:03] SubStack: I like how node is the first big post-github framework
[16:04] jetienne_: Bartzy: because concurrency is irrelevant

[16:58] Guest11664: But it would help because the templates are static files
[16:58] Guest11664: So they could be cached at the server and the client if need be
[16:58] boxysean: stride: i'm looking, thanks :)
[16:58] Detroitboy: How do you get DOM in node.js?
[16:58] Guest11664: I'm not entirely sure you do
[16:59] Guest11664: Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to, which is kind of what we are talking about
[16:59] Guest11664: :)
[16:59] framlin: If I have to create WebPages, I use nodejs and jQuery to create the DOM
[16:59] framlin: jsdom
[16:59] framlin: that runs on nodejs ..
[17:00] mwl has joined the channel
[17:00] framlin: and there is nort reason, why I should not be able to cache that
[17:01] bingomanatee: In my experience putting DOM in a DRY context further removes your templates from your designers; i.e., it makes more work for you , and not necessarily the kind of work I consider meaningful. 
[17:01] framlin: becaus the cahce would sit in front of that part of the system that has to process the WebPages
[17:02] framlin: ok, but I have no designers
[17:02] framlin: ;)
[17:02] bingomanatee: jQuery has a nice templating language thats relatively accessible.
[17:02] Guest11664: Cache things like <div id="userid">12</userid><div class="message">Sup Jive Turkey, I am number 12</div>
[17:02] Guest11664: ?
[17:02] Guest11664: Because you could, yeah
[17:02] Detroitboy: bingomanatee: What does DRY mean?
[17:02] Guest11664: Don't Repeat Yourself
[17:02] Guest11664: Anyhow, that would only be shared for that user
[17:03] bingomanatee: Don't repeat yourself; the whole YAML/Coffeescript/HAML school of development
[17:03] Guest11664: So it would be memory intensive, and when ANY data changes, your cache is invalidated
[17:03] Guest11664: So on a dynamic web page it doesn't work so well
[17:03] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[17:04] framlin: I can not see any connection, between the question, where you process your pages and if you reapeat anything ...
[17:04] Guest11664: Nah, just trying to answer a question
[17:04] Guest11664: Sorry about the confusion
[17:04] framlin: Guest11664: but I see your point concernig cache
[17:04] Guest11664: Although, this does help that 
[17:05] vbn has joined the channel
[17:05] Guest11664: What I am gathering is that this is relatively unexplored territory
[17:06] Guest11664: I should probably push this code to github or something...
[17:06] bingomanatee: You could try popping github -- who knows what you'll get!
[17:07] Guest11664: WOAH! I got a ruby implementation of brainf**k!
[17:07] Guest11664: I got a dinner eating simulator!
[17:07] Guest11664: I got all the code to a major social network!
[17:07] Guest11664: These are all so useless, yet fun! :)
[17:08] framlin: DRY and seperation of responsibility are general development-goals, but I do not think, that they are connected to tempolating or not or Ruby vs. JavaScript or some like that
[17:09] Detroitboy: Why can't I pass a string as a reference?
[17:09] Guest11664: I think they *are* connected to templating :) I suppose we'll see

[17:16] Guest11664: Hmm...
[17:17] Guest11664: I think he starts with some good thoughts
[17:17] Guest11664: But he constrains the solution 
[17:17] Guest11664: You don't need the server to do the templating
[17:17] Guest11664: Once you stop doing that, this problem goes away

In a lot of other javascript scripts, I see the whole file's code contents wrapped like so: (function(){   ..module contents.. })()  What is the point of doing this?  In node.js, is this design improper form?
[17:55] jbpros has joined the channel
[17:55] jetienne_: EM03: the error is elsewhere
[17:55] jetienne_: EM03: seriously you do require('express') and you get an exception ?
[17:55] SubStack: explodes: that is a workaround for how the browser doesn't have a module system
[17:56] SubStack: but node's module system is quite nice so it's unnecessary!
[17:56] EM03: can i do npm install -g -d
[17:56] EM03: ?
[17:56] jetienne_: no clue i dont use npm it never worked for me
[17:56] SubStack: explodes: here's more about modules: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/all.html#modules
[17:56] jetienne_: i do node_modules instead
[17:56] explodes: SubStack: And the potential polluting of global variables is of no concern?
[17:57] jetienne_: EM03: let me say it differently, i created a new project yesterday with express. and all went ok
[17:57] SubStack: explodes: you have to go out of your way to pollute the global namespace thankfully
[17:58] EM03: Error: Cannot find module 'express'
[17:58] EM03: but i run express somedir/   << and all works fine 
[17:58] explodes: Excellent
[17:58] SubStack: explodes: if you just require() files you'll be fine since node already puts a (function () {})() around everything
[17:58] jetienne_: EM03: well you need to install express
[17:58] EM03: ^^
[17:58] explodes: Oh whaddup
[17:58] EM03: i did npm install express -g

[17:59] EM03: nmod?
[18:00] jetienne_: EM03: a single node.js script which read npm database and install it in local node_modules
[18:00] jetienne_: simple and predictable
[18:00] EM03: where is the file?

[18:03] jetienne_:  Flash Player ? no good

[18:03] boxysean: okay. i have done a bit, removing/adding new transports
[18:03] boxysean: will try a bit more
[18:03] jetienne_: put a long polling one before flash
[18:04] jetienne_: my guess is that you got flash on your android but a version which isnt cool for socket.io

[19:56] EM03: modules sorry

[19:57] EM03: i mean i got all the needed things , jade etc

[19:59] EM03: i was thinking of using sequealize honestly .....
[19:59] EM03: what do you think of that?
[19:59] EM03: how do you use your db stuff?
[19:59] EM03: I have no issue with SQL myself personally 
[20:00] akiva: So far I haven't delved too deeply in heavy DB stuff. I am quite into Mongo and that, but Sequelize does look promising
[20:00] EM03: hmm actually I think i want to use SQL directly hmm 
[20:00] akiva: I am not really for ORMs at all, so I woudln't know about that
[20:00] EM03: i like orm's alot but sometimes they go overboard
[20:00] akiva: ORMs are deceptive beasts
[20:01] EM03: my issue with orm's is that sometimes I think the closer you are to the data the better the db 
[20:01] EM03: and the application 
[20:01] EM03: I was a dba for quite some time
[20:01] EM03: some people who don't write sql alot like orm's because it seems to abstract it away a little 
[20:01] EM03: I feel so much more comfortable with sql directly though
[20:01] akiva: You shouldn't abstract SQL at all
[20:02] akiva: Ever.
[20:02] akiva: But I understand where they are coming from.
[20:02] akiva: I recently tweeted to a great blog post about just that very thing
[20:02] dguttman has joined the channel
[20:02] tmzt: anybody know how with or without mongoose to get a cursor that sends all the results then a complete event? I've tried just handling results == null as the complete but it doesn't work consistently
[20:03] akiva: It seems contrary to any reasoning to worry so much about abstracting SQL statements. Rarely does a project ever switch DBs, and even when they do, it's hardly such an issue that it's worth the performance hit of an ORM
[20:03] EM03: akiva: to people who don't use sql alot , working with data in that way sounds great 
[20:03] EM03: but I'm super super quick with sql 
[20:03] EM03: yea the whole db agnostic stuff is kinda stupid 
[20:03] EM03: i never change 
[20:04] akiva: EM03: I think they are tricking themselves into thinking that because they don't want to learn the SQL. SQL is extremely easy. If anyone really considers themselves a programmer, they ought to know it.
[20:04] EM03: unless you do some stupid stuff like put facebook on sqlite 
[20:04] EM03: yes , we think alike , I love my joins 
[20:04] perezd has joined the channel
[20:04] EM03: all the many to one crap that orm's do add more complexity in so many ways

[20:04] akiva: ALWAYS use models for data
[20:05] EM03: yes for sure 
[20:05] EM03: nothing against models 
[20:05] EM03: its the model tied to an ORM is my issue

[20:06] EM03: sometimes it feels to obvious and people call it the PHP way .....its more like the computer science way, most db crucial apps outside of web apps work directly with SQL 
[20:06] akiva: Laziness causes more laziness, which causes only headaches long term.

[20:08] akiva: Express is pretty nice, from what I have found so far. It helps that it's quite light.

[20:08] akiva: I am still tempted to just roll my own system for some apps
[20:08] fille: bnei akiva?
[20:08] kkaefer: akiva: why would you roll your own over express/connect?
[20:09] akiva: kkaefer: Not every app calls from the same set up. If I make some thing really light, it may prove more interesting to try my own microframework out tailored to do only what the app needs. Plus it helps to learn new things.
[20:09] akiva: fille: Yes?
[20:09] akiva: My name is Akiva, too
[20:09] fille: nice :D

[20:11] akiva: I have used it before, but as much as I love Ruby, it's too sluggish for my liking.
[20:11] tmzt: nmap
[20:11] blueadept: ah that's it
[20:11] blueadept: thanks!
[20:11] akiva: Rails 3 is nice. The older ones, no.

[20:13] EM03: akiva: i love ruby as well .....well actually no i hate ruby I <3 smalltalk so that means I have to love ruby because its the only similar language that has that much smalltalk influence
[20:13] EM03: but JS just works and v8 is super quick
[20:14] akiva: EM03: Objective C has some smalltalk influence in there.
[20:14] fille: EM03 why do u need to be convinced, what do u think ?
[20:14] EM03: oh yea I do like objc a well 
[20:14] akiva: But I am trying to focus mainly on NodeJS these days.

[20:16] akiva: Express is nice, yes. But like I said, it may be worth while to try to work only in node to start, learning how all the modules come together.
[20:16] fille: i dont like javascript, it has nothing with what i learnd in school
[20:17] tmzt: very hard to do node without javascript
[20:17] fille: exactly, but i learnd java and .NET in school
[20:17] AvianFlu: so forget them to make space for node
[20:18] AvianFlu: that's what I did with perl :-P
[20:18] akiva: .NET is the devil. Java is not far behind. lol
[20:18] akiva: Java is okay in some ways, but not really for me.
[20:18] fille: already did ,but what happend if u scale up a node.js project 
[20:18] akiva: It's incredibly bloated, but at least it is fast.
[20:18] AvianFlu: actually, I would say that PHP is the devil
[20:18] AvianFlu: there's more temptation involved
[20:19] AvianFlu: "Write me!  I'm easy!  Don't worry about sanitizing your input..."
[20:19] akiva: PHP is as good as the developer behind it.
[20:19] akiva: Many of the most heavily trafficked sites are using PHP
[20:19] AvianFlu: ultimately, I agree; though my joke stand

[22:51] vyvea: Hello, what name of "sys" is on v0.5.1-pre?
[22:52] bnoordhuis: mraleph: why is `for (var i = 0; i < 10e6; ++i)` roughly 5-10 times slower than `for (var i = 0; i < 1000 * 1000; ++i)`?
[22:52] bnoordhuis: and i know the former is a floating-point number
[22:53] alek_br_ has joined the channel
[22:53] bnoordhuis: but why doesn't v8 pick up the fact that it's a constant in this context?
[22:53] Wa has joined the channel

[22:55] mange has joined the channel
[22:55] Badababuba has joined the channel
[22:56] mraleph1: bnoordhuis: well. it is 10 times slower because u do 10 times more iterations :-)

[22:58] mikey_p: llrcombs: that's pretty cool
[22:58] llrcombs: mikey_p: it's pretty weird
[22:58] llrcombs: it has to do with binary math and losing precision
[22:58] bnoordhuis: mraleph1: ah! *hangs head in shame*
[22:58] bnoordhuis: embarrassing
[22:58] llrcombs: could someone explain to me how that works, and how to prevent it from fscking up my code?
[23:00] mikey_p: llrcombs: i meant the graph
[23:00] mikey_p: llrcombs: can you add channels?
[23:00] mraleph1: oh Math.LOG2E is not log_e 2 argh
[23:00] llrcombs: it runs in any chan I join

[23:01] llrcombs: because it' on my BNC
[23:01] llrcombs: *it's
[23:01] llrcombs: I might split it off to run on its own, just in any channel I ask it to, eventually
[23:01] mraleph1: bnoordhuis: yeah. this days a rarely use anything I learned about math in school. not speaking about uni
[23:01] llrcombs: but for now, I have to find a channel worthwhile-ish to add it
[23:01] mraleph1: s/a rarely/I rarely/

[23:02] llrcombs: mikey_p: what channel do you want it in?
[23:03] llrcombs: I'll evaluate
[23:03] llrcombs: and if I decide I don't want it, I can walk you through running it yourself
[23:03] mikey_p: I was just curious what'd it look like in drupal-contribute
[23:03] Nuck has joined the channel
[23:03] llrcombs: oh, just curiosity about a particular chan
[23:04] mikey_p: yeah
[23:04] llrcombs: they're generated based on live data
[23:04] llrcombs: not logs
[23:04] llrcombs: so it'd have to be in there for a while to get going
[23:04] llrcombs: if you wanna run my script, though, I'll help you out

[23:05] jmoyers: llrcombs thats not a javascript problem

[23:12] chapel: llrcombs: you should make it so you can see a specific persons social map
[23:13] llrcombs: chapel: that would be rediculously complex
[23:13] llrcombs: because I didn't write the actual bot
[23:13] chapel: well I don't know how you are dealing with the data
[23:13] chapel: I assumed you wrote it
[23:13] llrcombs: I modded it to output .json rather than actually rendering .pngs
[23:13] chapel: ah
[23:13] chapel: thats cool
[23:14] chapel: whats the bnc?
[23:14] llrcombs: the .json contains the loctations of all the nodes, and the ends, thickness, and opacity of all the bonds
[23:14] llrcombs: I also wrote the HTML/JS magic of the webpage
[23:14] sivy has joined the channel
[23:14] chapel: nice
[23:14] chapel: what bnc software?
[23:15] llrcombs: ZNC
[23:15] chapel: kk, thats what I use
[23:15] chapel: I need to finish the bnc Im writing in node
[23:16] llrcombs: if you read the code, it actually has full support for real live-updates
[23:16] llrcombs: via EventSource and Node.js

[23:21] llrcombs: then I won't need a dir watcher!

[23:27] mikey_p: llrcombs: it'd be cool if it had a history slider that worked like etherpad
[23:27] mikey_p: just drag side to side to go back and forth through old revisions
[23:27] mikey_p: and then a play button to play forward from any point in the past
[23:31] llrcombs: mikey_p: it does have history, just not in the form of a slider
[23:31] llrcombs: would you like a slider?
[23:32] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[23:32] llrcombs: the play button wouldn't be too difficult either
[23:32] mikey_p: and you have to hold down the little button to 'play' the history
