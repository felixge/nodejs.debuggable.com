[01:05] jgabbard: But that will execute it
[01:05] MooGoo: you can wrap a source file in (function() { ...code... }) and have node check that

[01:08] MooGoo: and monitor stderr
[01:08] chjj: right, he doesnt want to execute it though
[01:08] jgabbard: Hrm... still though, I don't want to execute the code
[01:08] MooGoo: it wont
[01:08] MooGoo: since it's wrapped in a function

[01:08] jgabbard: Oh, interesting

[01:08] chjj: yeah that could work
[01:09] MooGoo: that's what I did for my bot
[01:09] jgabbard: Wouldn't that require writing a temp file?
[01:09] MooGoo: to hotload modules and not have it crash if I forget a {
[01:09] MooGoo: no

[01:12] jbroman: I'm not sure whether the Function constructor is safer.
[01:12] MooGoo: well
[01:12] MooGoo: you could use new Function(code)
[01:12] jbroman: It probably is.
[01:12] jgabbard: ah, true

[01:15] jgabbard: He seems earnest and trustworthy to me
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I agree
[01:15] jbroman: Ha, apparently the Function constructor allows arbitrary code evaluation in exactly the same way eval does (in the same I gave above).

[02:59] apardo has joined the channel
[02:59] level09_: ajpiano: so you think web services is the answer
[03:00] level09_: like rest or soap / xml rpc
[03:00] level09_: or even json would be better
[03:00] level09_: since node speaks json
[03:00] level09_: for now I'll try to dump my node output into mongoose and read it with php
[03:00] v0idless- has joined the channel
[03:03] ajsie: level09_: if you don't need persistence for the data sent back and forth you won't need a db
[03:03] ajsie: i think HTTP is the answer
[03:03] ajsie: and its pretty simple doing this
[03:03] level09_: how
[03:03] ajsie: its far better than writing it to a file
[03:04] ajsie: since with HTTP your php and node servers can be in different locations
[03:04] level09_: I'm interacting with a php site based on drupal
[03:04] ajsie: setup a http server with node.js
[03:04] level09_: and I need to send complex objects from node
[03:04] ajsie: which is pretty simple
[03:04] level09_: aha
[03:04] level09_: I got your point
[03:04] ajsie: then you just fire http requests from php
[03:04] level09_: so the php site will interact with the node server 
[03:05] ajsie: and node.js will send back whatever info php wants
[03:05] level09_: so I use curl to get data
[03:05] level09_: from express server for example
[03:05] ajsie: if you want node.js to retrieve info from php you can do that aswell with php+apache
[03:05] ajsie: yeah
[03:05] level09_: good idea !
[03:06] level09_: thanks
[03:06] level09_: will give that a try
[03:06] level09_: better pass json strings through http and decode them in php 
[03:06] level09_: that would solve the whole thing
[03:06] ajsie: yeah
[03:07] ajsie: HTTP is the shit
[03:07] level09_: indeed
[03:07] ajsie: after websockets =)
[03:07] level09_: did not have time to play with websockets .. socket.io killed it all
[03:07] level09_: cant wait for a stable version though
[03:07] ajsie: socket.io is using websockets beneath
[03:08] level09_: i know, but I did not have to read into websocket api
[03:08] level09_: socket.io simplified it all 
[03:08] ajsie: yeah
[03:08] ajsie: same as using Ajax .. just use a library
[03:08] ajsie: far better than knowing all the low level coding
[03:08] level09_: exactly

[03:15] level09_: JakeyChan: about what
[03:15] level09_: ajsie: that is cool
[03:16] level09_: but a bit slow on my mac 
[03:16] level09_: flash sucks on chrome / mac
[03:16] JakeyChan: level09: http://artofthetrench.com/ can do with javscript ?
[03:17] level09_: I think it can be redesigned in html5/js
[03:18] level09_: not sure if they're using some flash specific features
[03:19] level09_: anyway, need to start reading on express 
[03:19] level09_: I guess I will use it as a json server for my php app
[03:21] level09_: so you guys expect node to be Ruby/Python killer :D
[03:21] jesusabdullah: I don't
[03:22] amerine has joined the channel
[03:22] jesusabdullah: I do think node will contribute to twisted and EventMachine becoming less popular
[03:22] chjj: well, ruby and python are languages
[03:22] jesusabdullah: indeed
[03:22] chjj: node is a platform
[03:22] chjj: which uses a particular language
[03:24] jerrysv: chjj: 2 languages
[03:24] jerrysv: 3 languages
[03:24] tbranyen: well it uses 3 langauges :-p

[03:27] level09_: is there a way to write some modules in c / c++ ?
[03:27] chjj: well the goal of node is to be able to do stuff in js without having to compile anything i suppose
[03:27] level09_: so far I was only using js 
[03:27] jerrysv: level09_: yes, as add-ons
[03:28] level09_: not that I really want to :D

[03:31] tbranyen: if i didn't have to worry about thread safety and gc in c++ i'd <3 it long tim

[03:32] tbranyen: if it isolated all globals per module then i'd consider it solved

[03:39] jesusabdullah: hah!

[03:43] tbranyen: urgh you have better bars
[03:43] level09_: why are associative arrays not recommended in js? or are they?
[03:43] tbranyen: i talk to random people about node and they tell me to leave them alone

[03:43] tbranyen: associative arrays have a length and order
[03:43] tbranyen: objects have neither
[03:43] jerrysv: ha. had a team building exercise that ended at a pub, everyone was asking what we were programming in
[03:44] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: nothing off of github is loading for me
[03:44] chjj: ecma also doesnt require object properties to be enumerated in insertion order
[03:44] jesusabdullah: jerrysv: D: That sucks!
[03:44] chjj: so the properties might be out of order
[03:44] level09_: tbranyen: how come, I can use myarr['something'] = value
[03:44] gkatsev: tbranyen: actually, no, they don't.
[03:44] chjj: depending on the engine
[03:44] level09_: it seems to work 
[03:45] jesusabdullah: jerrysv: It's the lolcode I used to calculate conductivities from a guarded hot plate lab
[03:45] chjj: v8 used to not go by insertion order, they do now
[03:45] Mkop: I have to find a page somewhere that explains all these terms clearly and precisely. e.g. what is js, ecma, v8, node, etc
[03:45] tbranyen: gkatsev: well even then, do you really feel comfortable calling an object with properties assigned to an associative array?
[03:45] jerrysv: jesusabullah: which is actually something i wanted to see. so double sucks
[03:45] tbranyen: gkatsev: you don't think an array should have a length?

[03:46] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: no idea
[03:46] jerrysv: on node-couch:  https://github.com/mabels/nodeoncouch
[03:46] tbranyen: gkatsev: also the whole for( whatever in object ) is reallly effed
[03:46] jerrysv: as per jchris
[03:46] gkatsev: tbranyen: perhaps. But an object IS an associate array.

[03:52] jesusabdullah: Mkop: "These results are incorrect" iirc
[03:52] jesusabdullah: He didn't comment on the language choice
[03:52] Mkop: what????
[03:52] jesusabdullah: though later, for another lab, he specified matlab
[03:52] jesusabdullah: and when I used python I lost a lot of points
[03:52] jesusabdullah: Yeah, the guy was totally straightfaced when it came to me trolling him
[03:52] jesusabdullah: I did this all the time
[03:52] apardo: jesusabdullah, i need a book about how on node
[03:52] SubStack: books are silly
[03:53] SubStack: apardo: you don't need books
[03:53] Mkop: on a first assignment where language wasn't specified, I totally would have given 5 extra credit points for working lolcode
[03:53] SubStack: internet is much faster
[03:53] jesusabdullah: apardo: If you know how2javascript, then you can just look at the node documentation
[03:53] Mkop: although I may have specified matlab for future assignments :-)
[03:53] jesusabdullah: which is, last I checked, quite clear and concise
[03:53] jesusabdullah: Mkop: That's because you're cooler than Old Man Bargar
[03:54] Mkop: anyone who doesn't even comment on an assignment being turned in in lolcode doesn't deserve to have assignments turned in in lolcode
[03:54] jesusabdullah: I think what I'd like to see is a book about interesting programming stuff that uses node because it's a good platform for that sort of thing
[03:54] apardo: jesusabdullah, and if i need to understand how node works ?
[03:55] Mkop: if I were mean, I would write "OMG WTF -5 KTHXBAI"
[03:55] Mkop: actually, if I were _really_ mean, I would write "OMG WTF -50 KTHXBAI"
[03:55] jesusabdullah: apardo: What do you need to understand, in particular, about how node works?
[03:55] Mkop: there are some people who learn things better from books. I happen to not be one of them
[03:56] apardo: jesusabdullah, i don't know yet
[03:56] jesusabdullah: Hah!
[03:56] SubStack: I am too critical for books
[03:56] jesusabdullah: I like learning from books as well
[03:56] jesusabdullah: I have a few of them!
[03:56] jesusabdullah: I just didn't find books helpful for node
[03:56] apardo: i like to learn from the masters
[03:56] SubStack: books are just one person yammering on and on about how to do stuff
[03:56] jerrysv: i read books. i found one in the garage the other day

[04:20] Nexxy: jerrysv, lol yeah I'm sure mine did too before we got her a PC
[04:20] SubStack: Mkop: citation needed
[04:20] Nexxy: there are plenty of aggressive chess players
[04:20] jesusabdullah: I think chess is a good game, and a fun mental challenge, but it's really no more special than any other relatively difficult game
[04:21] jesusabdullah: You could say the same of Starcraft
[04:21] jesusabdullah: but very few people do
[04:21] Mkop: Mkop, personal interview, Freenode/#Node.js, July 7, 2011.
[04:21] Mkop: MLA formatting and all.
[04:21] jesusabdullah: In fact, I suspect that Starcraft would be *more* useful
[04:21] jesusabdullah: since, in the year 2020, Predator drones will be controlled with a repurposed mmo-rts interface
[04:21] Mkop: just like middle school. you can write crap as long as you cite that some adult told you this crap in a personal interview
[04:21] SubStack: hand-eye coordination training in addition to tactics
[04:22] jesusabdullah: Our soldiers have uber micro
[04:22] Nexxy: Mkop, but can you prove that you're an adult? ;o
[04:22] jerrysv: wow. reminds me of a movie ...

[04:22] chjj: !
[04:22] Nexxy: do you make groaning noises when you get up or sit down?
[04:23] jerrysv: both :/
[04:23] brainproxy: might it depend on where you're sitting down?
[04:23] Nexxy: congratulations! you're an adult!

[04:24] jerrysv: on that note, i know tmpvar and mikeal are popping in at the end of the month, anyone else hitting oscon and want to meet up?
[04:25] Mkop: no groaning noises. I guess that means I'm a child.
[04:25] Mkop: does that mean I can skip work tomorrow?
[04:25] ryah: im going to oscon
[04:26] ryah: i think i'll only be there for the node day
[04:26] ryah: but we should go out that night

[04:28] brainproxy: ryah: I'm going to be giving an intro to node talk in St. Louis on July 21; your talks are obviously good ref material, but do you recommend any online/recorded intro talks where you think the presenter did an especially good job?
[04:28] brainproxy: iow, I'm looking for multiple sources of inspiration
[04:28] ryah: brainproxy: um. i don't know
[04:29] brainproxy: for giving the "Hello, Node" demo kind of thing
[04:29] brainproxy: ryah: okay, np
[04:29] jesusabdullah: Conferences?!
[04:29] jerrysv: brainproxy: i liked the 100k part at nodeconf
[04:29] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: oscon?
[04:29] jerrysv: 10k? 1m?
[04:29] jesusabdullah: Not me!
[04:30] jesusabdullah: Someday perhaps, but not for a while

[04:38] Prometheus: hrm
[04:38] Prometheus: are there any noticeable differences in performance between .match and .exec?
[04:38] Prometheus: (I'm guessing not, but hey..)
[04:38] chjj: match is a proxy to exec underneath the surface
[04:38] jesusabdullah: Mkop: Use dnode and node-irc to make a web-based irc client.
[04:38] SubStack: Prometheus: why would that even matter?
[04:38] Prometheus: chjj: so use exec? =)
[04:39] jesusabdullah: Mkop: Bonus points if it looks and acts more or less like irssi
[04:39] Prometheus: SubStack: it wouldn't, I'm just wondering :)
[04:39] chjj: match behaves differently with the "g" flag though
[04:39] chjj: they technically do different things
[04:39] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:39] chjj: but most of the time match will delegate to exec i think, you can look at how v8 implements it
[04:39] Mkop: I assume that node plays nicely with sqlite or the like?
[04:40] Prometheus: if the v8 code looks anything like what was linked here earlier
[04:40] Prometheus: I'll just skip it and take your word for it
[04:40] Prometheus: =P
[04:40] chjj: no no no, im talking about the stuff thats actually written in js
[04:40] Prometheus: ah
[04:40] chjj: a lot of the methods are written in js
[04:40] chjj: like match
[04:40] chjj: all the prototype methods on the global constructors
[04:40] chjj: a lot of it is in js
[04:40] Prometheus: interesting
[04:41] chjj: but you can see that .match delegates to .exec
[04:41] chjj: another interesting thing that people dont seem to realize is
[04:41] chjj: .slice and .substr are just proxies to .substring
[04:41] jesusabdullah: I don't actually know what .exec does
[04:41] jesusabdullah: I know what .match does
[04:41] jesusabdullah: but, yeah
[04:41] chjj: they have different behavior that is layered on of course
[04:41] jesusabdullah: sure
[04:42] chjj: but substring is technically the fastest
[04:42] chjj: if you dont need the behavior of slice
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Yeah, but when would you actually notice this speed increase?

[04:43] chjj: im not saying you should, im just saying thats the way it is
[04:43] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that's the only real case I can think of
[04:43] chjj: thats the way it is in v8 at least
[04:43] chjj: cant say for other js engines, but who cares about them

[04:45] tbranyen: p sure it is
[04:45] chjj: i thought so too, because everyone was using it
[04:45] chjj: and then i wrote benchmarks and looked at v8's code
[04:45] chjj: substring is faster
[04:46] tbranyen: http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-substr/3

[10:09] guidocalvano: hey people, I'm building a game and want to use node for scripting and communication. I want to link it to ogre3d. I'm on mac so i need an application bundle to start ogre. long story short it's probably easiest to link to node as a lib, so im building node as a lib. but... i need to compile it as ia32 architecture. And that gives me an error because I'm compiling for the wrong macosx target
[10:09] guidocalvano: so how do i set a different macosx target when I build node?
[10:10] guidocalvano: or does someone happen to have a libnode.a for mac in ia32 architecture lying around?

[11:14] hdon: burg, figure it out yet?
[11:14] sounko: which doesn't allow root ssh
[11:14] sounko: so when i login as my admin user, i need to sudo stuff
[11:14] sounko: when running node as sudo it works fine
[11:15] sounko: but when i run node app.js i get permission denied
[11:15] sounko: which is only an issue when trying to use forever start app.js
[11:15] hdon: sounko, i bet the very first EPERM you'll get is for trying to bind to a port < 1024
[11:15] burg: hdon, not really. what i am trying is not working (req.write('var=something');)
[11:16] sounko: hdon: ah ok that probably makes sense
[11:16] sounko: more dumb question, how do i just fix that :p
[11:16] sounko: allow ports < 1024
[11:17] hdon: sounko, you won't want to do that globally, but you could have one user, called app or whatever (named after app.js or whatever you want) that could be able to do it
[11:17] sounko: yeah i guess :( i mean for production that makes sense
[11:17] sounko: but just for me messing around i wanted to do it globally
[11:19] hdon: hmm
[11:19] sounko: you're absolutely right forever works fine on > 1024
[11:19] sounko: :)
[11:19] sounko: i just wanted a hack port 80 for the moment
[11:20] hdon: sounko, what kernel do you get on your vm?
[11:21] hdon: linux?
[11:21] sounko: err i guess :p

[11:23] hdon: sounko, ah, good :)
[11:23] hdon: sounko, http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral_ports.html#Solaris
[11:23] hdon: > Solaris also provides options to change the privileged port range (ports only processes running with superuser privileges can use).
[11:24] sounko: you're the best :)
[11:24] sounko: thanks so much
[11:24] xerox: you can also use some standard httpd to route the requests

[11:47] sounko: hahah don't ask

[11:48] sounko: na man, we're fucked

[11:49] sounko: my boss is working on data modelling
[11:49] Squax: hey, anyone had the exception thrown using socket.io "(node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit" ?
[11:49] hdon: about equal parts client-side and server-side work i think
[11:50] hdon: sfoster, provide example, platform, node version, test case, etc.
[11:50] hdon: sfoster, or.. just explain your problem first :P
[11:50] sfoster: hdon: yup, coming up. 
[11:50] sfoster: I'm trying to get a wizard kind of stdin UI, and probably doing something horribly wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/sfoster/y3cGy/

[11:51] `3rdEden: Squax fixed in master repo
[11:51] `3rdEden: will land with next release
[11:51] sfoster: that fires the end event.. but then my stdin stream is shut down, and I cant seem to re-open it? 
[11:51] stepheneb has joined the channel
[11:51] `3rdEden: And it's not exception Squax, it's a warning
[11:52] boehm has joined the channel
[11:52] hdon: sfoster, that's correct. your tty driver (in your kernel) will close your process's stdin when you send EOF (^d)
[11:52] Squax: thanks `3rdEden :D
[11:52] hdon: sfoster, there's a way around it.. *thinks*
[11:52] sfoster: hdon: how else should I signal (as a end-user) that I'm done entering text? 
[11:53] hdon: sfoster, well some programs have a special string to enter. sendmail ends multiline input when you enter only a line containing a "."
[11:53] unomi has joined the channel
[11:53] hdon: sfoster, but i am checking out alternatives..
[11:53] sfoster: so re-opening the stdin is not an option huh
[11:54] hdon: sfoster, i think by default, no. i think node would have to make a syscall to turn that option off in the tty driver
[11:54] hdon: sfoster, obviously many programs catch ^d without closing stdin
[11:54] sfoster: maybe I should be looking at the tty module..I think there is one, right? 
[11:55] sfoster: ACTION grasps at straws
[11:58] theCole_ has joined the channel
[11:59] hdon: sfoster, what happens if you type space, ^d, enter?
[11:59] vikstrous has joined the channel
[11:59] hdon: sfoster, i think the tty driver will not close if ^d is not hit at the beginning of the line
[12:00] hdon: sfoster, but even that is more keystrokes than .(enter)
[12:00] andyl has joined the channel
[12:00] sfoster: trying..
[12:01] sfoster: <space>^D doesn't trigger the on end, its just more data
[12:01] sfoster: But yeah I could scan the input for some sequence like that
[12:01] hdon: sfoster, well, i guess you could use that.. does eof show up as 0x0a?

[12:13] sfoster: thanks for you help. 
[12:13] hdon: sfoster, awesome :) thanks for sharing the solution
[12:14] sfoster: When it works works, I'll update the fiddle, or make a gist or something. 
[12:15] hdon: sfoster, lol, it's funny to see fiddle used for nodejs code. i heard ry is working on Node.js API for Spidermonkey, though. So it might not be too long before a Firefox add-on let's us Node.js inside jsfiddle :D
[12:16] hdon: (actually i started working on my own impl, but around the same time i got busy with other stuff, and ry or someone got started taking a very different track toward a Spidermonkey impl)

[13:29] cbiscardi has joined the channel
[13:29] jbroman: huang47_: Make sure you supply a valid Content-Type and Content-Length (you can used chunked transfer encoding instead of the latter if you prefer).
[13:30] mehtryx: specifically….when they say export functions for testing…do they simply mean recreate it in a test_script.js with the syntax for testing or is there something that "exports" the appropriate pieces to test?
[13:30] jbroman: In general, the querystring module is useful for URL encoding post body (as application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which is what HTML forms submit, is URL encoded).

[14:57] ryah: eldios: good :) just landed a big reorg of libuv https://github.com/joyent/libuv/commit/ce8ff3031c36b069e1da42b0f3bf0373ca42f2a6
[14:58] tuhoojabotti: What is libuv?
[14:58] Illusioneer has left the channel
[14:58] eldios: libev for micro$oft
[14:58] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[14:58] tuhoojabotti: what is libev?
[14:58] eldios: windooze
[14:58] tuhoojabotti: :D
[14:58] eldios: LOL
[14:58] eldios: what makes you happy when you use nodejs
[14:58] fille: elite
[14:58] dall: Jalava_, but i can only do one query for each connection...so persistent maybe should worst for a lot of queries
[14:58] dall: no?
[14:59] tuhoojabotti: ah
[14:59] eldios: (the lib which let the event loop work, long story short)
[14:59] tuhoojabotti: lib event
[14:59] Emmanuel_ has joined the channel
[14:59] eldios: yup
[14:59] tuhoojabotti: that would have satisfied me.
[14:59] dall: Jalava_, how to create a pool of connections ?
[14:59] grekko has joined the channel
[14:59] eldios: but we are generous and cover you with a plentyfull of useless funny answers first
[14:59] eldios: =)
[14:59] tuhoojabotti: I'm not familiar with all these abbreviations yet.
[15:00] Jalava_: dall: well, by creating pool of connection and holding the status of each connection somewhere
[15:00] tuhoojabotti: ryah: What is that?
[15:00] ryah: tuhoojabotti: libuv? it's libev for windows
[15:01] ryah: more or less :)
[15:01] eldios: hey! I answered that first! :P
[15:01] Jalava_: and then handling cases where you run out of connections, or connection is not released in timely manner
[15:01] tuhoojabotti: No not that
[15:01] tuhoojabotti: :D
[15:01] tuhoojabotti: ryah: The link
[15:01] eldios: and my answer was even more funny!
[15:01] Sembiance has joined the channel
[15:01] ryah: tuhoojabotti: so people can call in to the office hour line
[15:01] dall: Jalava_, makes sense but....i only can execute one query with one connection....so how could know what "connection" is unload ?
[15:02] Jalava_: dall: because you store the connection to request and when request is complete you release it in final middleware 
[15:02] jtsnow has joined the channel
[15:02] Jalava_: or something like that
[15:02] sub_pop has joined the channel
[15:02] stepheneb has joined the channel
[15:02] tuhoojabotti: ryah: So you answer questions once a week, like customer service? :P
[15:02] ryah: tuhoojabotti: yep
[15:02] dall: Jalava_, smart
[15:02] davidascher has joined the channel
[15:02] Jalava_: of course, you should manage your query routing during request also, so you don't do all queries at same time
[15:02] tuhoojabotti: Thats enough questions from me
[15:03] eldios: at least until there's 1M+ in here
[15:03] dall: Jalava_, with middleware is nothing to do with express web framework like, do youmean other?
[15:03] eldios: it could become quite a mess after that point
[15:03] sbisbee_ has joined the channel
[15:03] eldios: anyway we're safe as for now as the chan seems to be stabilized about 600 ppl
[15:03] Jalava_: yeah, i'm talking about express style middleware that handles requesting the connection from pool and releasing it

[15:20] bshumate has joined the channel
[15:21] eldios: oh ryah.. another question (for real this time): I used to use inspect to actually see the code of a Function or the inner specs of an object (say to see which methods, attributes, etc). Now is not working anymore. Am I using it wrong or what? Do you have any suggestion? (I meainly use this in the REPL when the doc of a module is not enough)
[15:21] eldios: s/meainly/mainly/
[15:21] ryah: CC=clang CXX=clang+ ./configure && make
[15:22] tuhoojabotti: Is there a update script for node?
[15:22] ryah: eldios: since when?
[15:22] tuhoojabotti: I want update to be as easy as installing was :P
[15:22] eldios: I suppose 0.4.8+ as it didn't work in 0.4.9 as I expected
[15:22] softdrink: clone, configure, make, make install?
[15:22] softdrink: hehe
[15:22] eldios: but it could also be that I forgot how I used it and I'm using it wrong now
[15:22] ryah: eldios: huh.. i'm not sure i follow - can you give me an example?
[15:22] eldios: sure
[15:23] ryah: tuhoojabotti: people use "nvm" for that
[15:23] vipaca has joined the channel
[15:23] vipaca has joined the channel
[15:23] ryah: the "node version manager"
[15:23] tuhoojabotti: I heard about that
[15:24] baudehlo: ryah: I think for some reason that didn't work, but my memory may be hazy. Something about the deps not picking it up.
[15:24] baudehlo: or the linker or something
[15:25] baudehlo: I should try again instead of speculating :)
[15:25] ryah: baudehlo: oh, could be
[15:25] eldios: ok.. ryah no problem.. I just figured it out myself
[15:25] eldios: I was using it wrong. When I want to inspect a function I use the toString()
[15:26] eldios: eg: console.log(process.error.toString())
[15:26] eldios: thank you anyway ^_^
[15:26] tuhoojabotti: Hmm
[15:27] tuhoojabotti: Does nvm install to the home folder?
[15:27] thalll has joined the channel

[15:31] tjholowaychuk: does it? interesting
[15:31] systemfault: About time imho.
[15:31] softdrink: why are they going crazy with clang and llvm? is it for opencl?
[15:31] systemfault: softdrink: Licensing.
[15:31] ryah: because it's awesome
[15:31] ryah: and they spent like 10 years making it :)
[15:31] softdrink: true, it /is/ awesome...
[15:31] systemfault: softdrink: Since GCC 4.3, GCC is GPL3 and Apple doesn't want it.
[15:32] tjholowaychuk: i've been using clang as the main compiler for one of my projects and even just from using clang  things are roughly 20% faster
[15:32] tjholowaychuk: than gcc
[15:32] systemfault: So they've been using a modified version of 4.2... and still do.
[15:32] softdrink: good ol' poisonous gpl...
[15:32] systemfault: Until clang is "ready"
[15:32] systemfault: 4.2 is now prehistoric :/
[15:32] baudehlo: xcode4 uses clang by default.

[15:33] systemfault: If the node.js codebase doesn't use some evil GCC-only stuff, it _should_ in theory compile on clang as is
[15:34] tjholowaychuk: clang doesn't have first class labels does it? (via flag or something?)
[15:34] systemfault: (As Apple created clang to be a drop-in replacement for GCC)
[15:34] baudehlo: it does compile on clang - I think it was just problematic because it didn't compile all the deps with clang (or something).
[15:34] tuhoojabotti: Where's the changelist for 0.5.0? :P
[15:35] tuhoojabotti: oh

[16:02] ryah: once the windows stuff is stablized
[16:03] baudehlo: I wonder if we'll need a libnode (dll or whatever) for windows so that someone can wrap it in a windows Service easily.
[16:03] taf2: ACTION needs to rework https://github.com/taf2/tiamat to use child_process.fork instead of custom fork
[16:03] baudehlo: as nobody is going to want an exe on Windows for a web server.
[16:03] ryah: baudehlo: yeah, running it as a service is in the plans
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: it would be kinda cool if npm had written reviews or something. "$ npm review express 'it sucks dont use it'"

[16:05] ryah: ah yes, and tests
[16:05] ryah: isaacs has good ideas about tests
[16:05] baudehlo: though then nodesters need to come up with some sort of standard for that.

[16:13] tjholowaychuk: which is even more useless
[16:14] baudehlo: tjholowaychuk: yes but for something like say a date/time module, you don't want tests to just stop, especially if you're reading someone else's test report.
[16:14] baudehlo: you want to know ALL the test failures, generally.

[16:15] kartmetal: Is there an equivalent to py2exe in the node.js world?

[16:15] baudehlo: I am disagreeing with tj about it :)
[16:16] baudehlo: I think with something like TAP and an equivalent of Test::Builder you can build a one-size-fits-all solution.

[16:19] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: i used expresso for jade and i totally regret it
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: i should have used what i did for stylus

[16:46] creationix: ankush: what kind of server is it that you don't have root
[16:47] creationix: ankush: node is just a normal process
[16:47] japj: ankush: is node installed on the server?
[16:47] jomoho2 has joined the channel
[16:47] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[16:47] thalll has joined the channel
[16:48] ankush: no..node is not yet installed ... it is a shared hosting..

[16:48] zachwe has left the channel
[16:48] ekryski has joined the channel
[16:48] creationix: ankush: you'll have to build node if it's not on there, the tools may be missing
[16:49] creationix: ankush: also, most shared hosts don't allow long-running process
[16:49] mjr_: gf3: you cannot, if they are indexed like that.  MGET is effectively a list.
[16:49] creationix: ankush: and you won't be able to listen on port 80 since it's shared by all the users and is already taken
[16:49] ankush: creationix, alright, I get it, so is there any free websocket server ?
[16:49] mjr_: gf3: You could also index them in a zset so you could do range queries, which is pretty handy for timeline things like that.
[16:50] creationix: ankush: I know some shared hosts have partial support for node, but you'll have to check with them on the specifics
[16:50] eventualbuddha_ has joined the channel
[16:50] creationix: ankush: the problem is that websockets are new and don't play nice with the architecture that most shared hosts use
[16:50] creationix: ankush: now vps hosting works great, but costs a little more
[16:51] ankush: creationix, I am not exactly looking for a node.. i just want a websocket for a real time app. 
[16:51] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[16:51] creationix: ankush: 
[16:51] gf3: mjr_: mhmm, I am thinking of using either a list or sorted-set, however I don't want to store the objects twice
[16:51] meat_popsicle_ has joined the channel
[16:51] creationix: ankush: right, but because of the nature of websockets, any server that supports them won't be a quick request-response type
[16:51] gf3: mjr_: I was just hoping redis had a built-in command to translate a list of IDs to a list of objects
[16:51] tuhoojabotti: ryah: I watched your talk :P
[16:51] perezd has joined the channel
[16:51] creationix: ankush: it's a long held persistent connection between the server and the browser
[16:51] ryah: tuhoojabotti: cool :)
[16:51] mjr_: gf3: it doens't, but it's super simple to transform a list of IDs into an MGET command
[16:52] tuhoojabotti: ryah: You're a terrible typoer. ;)
[16:52] ankush: creationix, hmm..yeah..Ive read some info over it, 
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: gf3 that's the joy of redis, it's just data structs that you stitch together
[16:52] ryah: tuhoojabotti: it's hard to type in front of people
[16:52] tuhoojabotti: Hehe
[16:53] gf3: mjr_, tjholowaychuk: cool cool, thanks guys
[16:53] tuhoojabotti: Typing when talking yeah
[16:53] creationix: ryah: indeed, my "workshop" at velocityconf turned out to be an hour and a hald of live coding in front of roughly 3000 people
[16:53] mjr_: gf3: client.mget(id_list.map(function (id) { return "tweet:" + id }), callback);
[16:53] ryah: creationix: 3000? holy crap
[16:53] creationix: ryah: and my laptop was not working so I had to borrow one last minute
[16:53] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[16:54] mjr_: Wow, 3000 is a ton
[16:54] creationix: ryah: roughly, maybe as low as 2100, not sure
[16:54] gf3: mjr_: heh, I just wrote almost exactly that
[16:54] ankush: creationix, so , what should I do, any low cost option ? I wish to build a realtime app, it will not generate much traffic initially, i guess
[16:54] creationix: ankush: I'd go for a cheap vps
[16:54] mjr_: I've never been to Velocity.  Large conferences like that seem like they be a big waste of time.  Were they?
[16:54] bene has joined the channel
[16:54] creationix: the mainstream ones are $20/month
[16:54] creationix: but I've heard of cheaper ones
[16:54] bene has left the channel
[16:55] creationix: ryah: can people buy no.de hosting yet?
[16:55] ryah: no
[16:55] mjr_: ankush: I've been very happy with these guys:  http://chunkhost.com/   They are $19/mo, and have a free trial.
[16:55] stash1 has joined the channel
[16:55] creationix: yeah, for $20 a month there are several high-quality providers
[16:55] creationix: they can handle modest traffic
[16:55] mjr_: $19/mo gets you 512MB, which is pretty great.
[16:56] tuhoojabotti: My hosting is 35€/y
[16:56] creationix: I personally like linode
[16:56] tuhoojabotti: :D

[16:56] creationix: chunkhost looks nice too
[16:56] tmpvar has joined the channel
[16:57] mjr_: I have like 5 different VPS instances, and I get the best performance from chunkhost.  It probably depends on which physical machine you end up on, and who the other tenants are, so it's hard to compare.
[16:57] Prometheus: intovps ;)
[16:57] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[16:57] mjr_: My linode instance is often really slow.
[16:57] creationix: mjr_: I think I got lucky, my instance is really fast
[16:58] creationix: mjr_: it's a gamble since the machines are shared
[16:58] Prometheus: I find that linode is more often fast than not
[16:58] Prometheus: got several clients on there on various servers
[16:58] creationix: my slicehost was really slow
[16:58] mjr_: I guess the best advice is to drop any account that seems slow, and then keep signing up for new ones until you get a fast one.
[16:58] Prometheus: heh
[16:58] creationix: mjr_: not a bad idea
[16:58] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[16:58] Prometheus: or contact support and tell them that your instance is slow =P
[16:58] mjr_: Hmm, my slicehost is slow too.

[17:02] blkcat: they were probably the best vps a few years ago but they've fallen way behind the competition now.
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: those gradients expand to the vendor specifics
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: and node-canvas can generate a gradient image for you
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: inlined
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: as a data uri, looks smoother than the browsers
[17:02] softdrink: nifty

[17:02] tjholowaychuk: though it has pretty much no docs :(
[17:03] creationix: ryah: btw, my live demo at my "workshop" crashed a few times, probably just OSX being retarded

[17:03] softdrink: i'll just wrap it in @css{} for now… it's just a stripey gradient for testing anyway
[17:03] creationix: had maybe 200-300 users all over local wifi
[17:03] ryah: why did it crash?
[17:03] creationix: I know one of the reasons was the low ulimit
[17:03] industrial: Having a little trouble with https://github.com/Industrial/node_site/blob/master/app.coffee . There's no app defined when I require https://github.com/Industrial/node_site/blob/master/app/users.coffee

[17:04] ankush: what about phpwebsocket? 
[17:04] creationix: ankush: that doesn't sounds like a good idea, I wonder how it works
[17:04] creationix: ankush: php is traditionally used in the short request-response style architecture
[17:04] Corren: any recommendations for job postings other than nodejs/stackoverflow/github
[17:05] Prometheus: blkcat: blame rackspace for the fall of slicehost =P
[17:05] ankush: see, my basic need is websocket, not node.js or socket.io.., so suggest me something 
[17:05] blkcat: Prometheus: indeed. :\
[17:05] industrial: How do I separate out the controller-y bits with express into separate files?
[17:05] DTrejo has joined the channel
[17:06] creationix: ankush: yeah, it looks like the phpwebsocker server is also a long-running process outside of apache
[17:06] creationix: ankush: so no easier to deploy than node
[17:06] creationix: ankush: and probably slower
[17:06] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[17:06] Prometheus: if your choice is between something glued together with php and node.js, it should be a fairly no brainer
[17:07] ankush: Prometheus, no, i just need a server implementation for websockets
[17:07] creationix: ankush: socket.io+nodejs is the easiest way in any language to deploy a websocket enabled server in any language
[17:07] industrial: Why would my require fail on the app var?
[17:07] industrial: I defined it before doing the loop and requiring the files
[17:07] Prometheus: ankush: do you have preference as far as languages go?
[17:07] Prometheus: like creationix said, socket.io+node.js is the easiest way to implement them :)

[17:08] xandrews has joined the channel
[17:08] industrial: hello?
[17:08] Robdor has joined the channel
[17:08] creationix: ankush: the problem is that you need a internet connected machine that lets you run a long running custom server
[17:08] Prometheus: if you just need websockets, then node-websocket-server :)
[17:08] creationix: ankush: once you've met that requirement, then you can pick a language and platform
[17:08] creationix: ankush: but without it, no language can implement a websocket server
[17:09] creationix: ankush: and at that point, node is the easiest platform
[17:09] ryah: industrial: can you restate your question - i don't think people really understood it
[17:09] ankush: creationix, yes, so how should i check that?
[17:10] Prometheus: ankush: do you have a server?
[17:10] Prometheus: (whether vps, dedicated..)
[17:10] industrial: I'm requiring a file which uses app.namespace and app.get, I get an error about app not existing in the file ./app/users.js, but I've defined the app even before looping and requiring every js file in ./app/. https://github.com/Industrial/node_site/blob/master/app.coffee line 65
[17:11] japj: argh.. why does github not have a mark duplicate bug feature?
[17:11] ankush: Prometheus, no, I can always get a free hosting !!! 
[17:11] Prometheus: :/
[17:11] creationix: industrial: require doesn't set any magic variables
[17:12] Prometheus: that explains the php I suppose
[17:12] creationix: industrial: it's just an expression, you have to save the result somewhere
[17:12] confoocious has joined the channel
[17:12] ankush: Prometheus, yes.. you are right..
[17:12] ryah: industrial: yes - what creationix said
[17:12] industrial: hm okay, i'd want it to just execute really
[17:12] ryah: that should be okay for executing it
[17:13] ryah: industrial: BTW you can link to individual lines in github like this: https://github.com/Industrial/node_site/blob/master/app.coffee#L65
[17:13] creationix: industrial: basically it loads the file and evals it inside a function wrapper with a little sugar to get at exported variables
[17:13] tjholowaychuk: industrial require './app/' + filename
[17:13] sweetd has joined the channel
[17:13] tjholowaychuk: needs to change
[17:13] Wizek_ has joined the channel
[17:14] creationix: industrial: is your error being thrown by the code inside the js file?
[17:14] creationix: I mean the js file you're requiring
[17:14] ankush: Prometheus, so? do I have enough  permissions to install node on a free host?
[17:14] tjholowaychuk: he's not passing "app" into it
[17:14] jmoyers: sounds like the common mistake coming from php
[17:14] jmoyers: or c for that matter
[17:14] tjholowaychuk: or grabbing it through the parent module etc
[17:14] jmoyers: you need to export app, and then pass app around
[17:14] Poetro__ has joined the channel
[17:15] Prometheus: ankush: depends on the host, but probably not
[17:15] Prometheus: unless you have access to the server over ssh

[17:15] Prometheus: typically that's not the case, though
[17:15] creationix: ankush: dreamhost has articles on how to build custom servers, but it's not well supported and most shared hosts don't like it
[17:16] Prometheus: ankush: you could get a free ec2 µ instance from amazon if you signed up for their free plan thing, I think it's still going, but..
[17:16] Prometheus: it's free for a year, and I'm not convinced on reliability of their machinery :)
[17:17] Prometheus: and probably has limits on computational hours too, can't remember
[17:17] industrial: creationix: yes, in the file I'm requiring
[17:17] ankush: ill check tht, i had joyent virtual hosting once, i got it for free.. I had ssh acces to it..
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: industrial you have a few options. module.exports = function(app){ ... }; and require(path)(app)
[17:17] vid_ has joined the channel
[17:17] industrial: ah
[17:17] creationix: industrial: ok, so the problem is that files you require don't have access to the closure scope of the file that requires them
[17:17] adrianmg has joined the channel
[17:17] jmoyers: ^
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: industrial: or export it in the parent and access it via module.parent or similar
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: or have a global "app"
[17:18] Prometheus: ankush: yeah, you'll need a machine w/ ssh, but presumably if that's all the server is doing it doesn't need to be very big "instance" :)

[17:55] embwab: isaacs: with npm link - works great, but it's not that automatic (npm install on new machines)
[17:55] isaacs: embwab: right
[17:55] embwab: isaacs: yeah, and git submodules have their own warts (can't even switch branches anymore)
[17:55] isaacs: embwab: once you get your machine set up, it's not terrible.

[17:55] embwab: isaacs: i guess I just need to make clone/deploy a little more complicated
[17:55] isaacs: embwab: but setting up a new machine is a little bit terrible.
[17:56] embwab: isaacs: ok, I thought I must have had something wrong - npm install is so awesome and easy, i figured this would be too :) Thanks for your hard work
[17:56] isaacs: embwab: the easiest way to be able to set your stuff up on any new machine is to set up your own repository

[17:56] Skola: yes that one
[17:56] isaacs: then you publish things into that registry, and the only "setup" you have to do is change the registry config
[17:56] aah: anyone using node w/ beanstalk?  running into EADDRNOTAVAIL issues, but FD use is well under max and temp port range is huge..
[17:56] isaacs: embwab: npm help registry
[17:57] replore has joined the channel
[17:57] isaacs: embwab: there's a bit of an up-front setup cost, but the maintenance is pretty easy after that.  just do the couchdb continuous replication to always have the latest public stuff, and publsh your private stuff into your private reg

[18:55] steffan has joined the channel
[18:55] isaacs: jsumners: most of the time that there's a symlink from node's process.execPath to a place in the PATH, it's because the location of the binary itself is volatile.  eg, /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.4.8/contents/bin/node
[18:55] isaacs: so, npm builds its defaults based on the output of `which node`
[18:55] isaacs: not the realpath
[18:55] jsumners: that's the problem
[18:55] isaacs: jsumners: ok, so you can do ./configure --prefix=~/bin/nodejs
[18:55] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[18:55] isaacs: jsumners: just like you did with node itslef.
[18:56] isaacs: jsumners: or, you can just put `prefix = ~/bin/nodejs` in your ~/.npmrc file (which is all that ./configure does)

[19:27] japj: bnoordhuis: I think that one is due to an include path issue resulting from moving ares

[20:16] techwraith: Ah
[20:16] Intel_iX: I need to store a database in RAM/swap.
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: that's my guess
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: if that's the case I'll use ._id
[20:17] bnoordhuis: japj: ?= assigns unless the variable is already set
[20:17] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: Just did that, I still don't seem to be processing jobs
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: looks totally fine to me
[20:18] kunal: japj, i m writing a binary file which has a specific format
[20:18] jerrysv: intel_ix: safely? or alpha code? :)
[20:18] kunal: japj, little endian
[20:18] bnoordhuis: japj: and make considers a var set even if it's empty - so i suspect make auto-defines CC='cc'

[20:21] Murvin: Intel_iX:  you should also look into APC cache.     if you need caching across multiple servers, the approach of using memcache and apc are different.  
[20:21] Intel_iX: I need to store binary data in ram
[20:21] red5: is there some example to create a web app using "express" ?

[20:22] Murvin: red5:  expressjs.com
[20:22] red5: ?
[20:22] jerrysv: intel_ix: if you're attempting to store binary data in ram, with fast access, unless you have some very special needs you're probably better off storing it externally
[20:22] stepheneb__ has joined the channel
[20:22] jerrysv: intel_ix: so i guess the real question is: what's the problem you are trying to solve?
[20:23] Intel_iX: No, the program needs to work without any tcp connections at all.
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: red5 the repo has a bunch of examples
[20:23] Intel_iX: Which is the big problem.
[20:23] jerrysv: no tcp connections at all? even to the local host? how about sqlite?
[20:23] red5: Murvin: ok. do u know some text describing how to build a full application ?
[20:23] Intel_iX: Not even localhost.
[20:23] japj: kunal: couldn't you just stream the s3 data through node to disk while knox gets it?
[20:23] Intel_iX: Also, it has to be random acesss binary data.
[20:23] isaacs: Murvin: you and your coworker have different versions of npm, i'm guessing
[20:24] Intel_iX: Would be a buffer... but they have horrible size limits.
[20:24] jerrysv: intel_ix: and why are you doing this in node?
[20:24] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: It should be ok to have these things in different processes, right? (the app server and the job server)
[20:24] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: also, in case you missed it: https://gist.github.com/1070442
[20:24] Murvin: red5: depending on what you need.  but you can go to github.com   search for express.  and you can see la lot of examples
[20:24] tjholowaychuk: techwraith yeah definitely, it runs with cluster no problem for me
[20:24] kkaefer: jerrysv: sqlite doesn't use networking

[20:25] kunal: japj, thats what.. the writing part is done in cpp... 
[20:25] Intel_iX: Plus high level abstraction...
[20:25] red5: tjholowaychuk, Murvin : thx guys
[20:25] kunal: japj, first its a header of 16 bytes.. then its a file from s3
[20:26] jerrysv: intel_ix: if you're just looking for fast access to binary data, and plan to never use it in production, and are ok running alpha code, i can point you in a direction
[20:26] dans: Nexxy, i want to timestamp each message and store which user said it
[20:26] jerrysv: intel_ix: but i would never recommend it
[20:26] Murvin: isaacs:  ok..  mine is 0.3.18  and my coworker is 1.0.15
[20:26] isaacs: Murvin: there you go
[20:26] isaacs: Murvin: get on the boat, man!
[20:26] Intel_iX: Link?
[20:26] Nexxy: dans, if you're using SQL just make some simple table w/ timestamp, userid, text, and target as columns

[20:26] Murvin: isaacs:  although older version.. hmm hmmm
[20:26] isaacs: Murvin: yours is working differently.
[20:27] isaacs: Murvin: you should upgrade.
[20:27] isaacs: Murvin: your coworker should read `npm help folders` to learn where npm puts stuff.
[20:27] Murvin: isaacs:  when I upgrade, do I need to reinstall all packages?
[20:27] japj: kunal: I think you can write binary data (the header) from node with buffers see also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4824328/generating-and-writing-binary-data-to-stream-in-node-js
[20:27] dans: Nexxy, i cant have a table for each chat room
[20:27] isaacs: Murvin: yes.
[20:27] Nexxy: dans, that's not what I'm suggesting
[20:27] Murvin: isaacs: ok
[20:28] isaacs: Murvin: npm can't know what you wanted to be global and what you wanted to be local, since npm 0.x put them all in the same place.
[20:28] Murvin: oh
[20:28] dans: Nexxy: doesn't sound like it would scale well, if i just store each chat message in one huge table
[20:28] Nexxy: well you're using SQL
[20:28] isaacs: Murvin: you CAN set the "clean=no" environment var to skip the cleanpu, but that's *really* not recommended.
[20:28] fattytuna has joined the channel
[20:28] Nexxy: so I figured scaling wasn't an issue
[20:28] dans: Nexxy: im not using SQL, i'm open at the moment
[20:28] dans: I was actually thinking of MongoDB
[20:28] Murvin: isaacs:  so, if I want it be global, i have to do npm install express -g?

[20:31] jerrysv: intel_ix: have you tried allocating the 5gb with a c++ add-on?
[20:31] hellp has joined the channel
[20:31] dans: Nexxy: At the moment my understanding is Mongo stores things like javascript objects/json
[20:31] Intel_iX: Not aware of any and I don't have c++ skill so I can't make one.
[20:31] japj: isaacs: currently npm can specify dependencies to other modules, have you thought about storing the (rpm/deb/brew) package names needed to compile certain addons? (which would be really usefull when starting a npm addon build server in order to know what packages need to be installed to actually compile a certain node addon)

[20:32] Intel_iX: Well, that's an associative array, not binary. Can't I just recompile with some variable changed or something?
[20:32] isaacs: japj: the current state of the art is to have a preinstall script that checks for what it needs.

[20:34] isaacs: japj: i see.
[20:34] dans: just seen MongDB does capped collections to with FIFO ordering: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Capped+Collections
[20:34] dans: too*
[20:34] isaacs: japj: how would you express it succinctly in a package.json file?  What would you like the behavior to be?  pseudocode and spec proposals are easier to digest and provide feedback on.
[20:34] isaacs: japj: even a bad first step is a first step :)

[20:35] Murvin: isaacs: and the module is installed in my /home/myuser/node_modules (when I run npm root)  is that correct?
[20:35] japj: isaacs: well, I already "discovered" that package names are not consistent on all platforms

[20:36] isaacs: Murvin: read that^
[20:37] kartmetal has joined the channel
[20:37] mraleph: Intel_iX: you can't access continuous 5gb through a single external array (buffer) but you can create a sliding "view".
[20:37] Intel_iX: mraleph, whatever it does, this still happens: > new Buffer(1000000000) \n terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
[20:37] sivy has joined the channel
[20:37] japj: isaacs: so it's either specifying all the different package names for all the platforms (i.e. brew:sdl, sdl_mixer; .deb libsdl1.2-dev libsdlmixer1.2-dev ; rpm SDL-devel SDL_mixer-devel) , 'detection' of library/include files or some complete other mechanism
[20:37] mraleph: Intel_iX: well that means malloc refused to give you that many memory :-)
[20:38] isaacs: japj: yeah.  sketch out some json
[20:38] japj: isaacs: but I think for automated build you'll need to have the actual package information so you can build in chroot environments
[20:38] Intel_iX: isn't that determined by the heap size when you compile it?
[20:38] justicefries has joined the channel
[20:38] Intel_iX: like, some compiler flag?
[20:38] isaacs: japj: also, how does npm know which to use?  that's an important sticky point
[20:38] isaacs: .
[20:38] Intel_iX: Or is that a malloc limit?
[20:38] mraleph: Intel_iX: you'll probably have to write your own memory management layer via mmap to operate on such a big chunks of memory. 
[20:38] radiodario has joined the channel
[20:39] kartmetal: Is there an easy way to say "Give me the next 10 bytes out of this Readable Stream", or would one need to potentially slice/combine incoming 'data' Buffers to do that?
[20:39] SubStack: kartmetal: you can use lazy for that
[20:39] mraleph: Intel_iX: I can be that OS refuses to give such a big continious chunk to your app.
[20:39] japj: isaacs: well, can you detect the running platform from v8? another way would be to 'detect' rpm/dpkg/brew or something similar
[20:39] SubStack: or actually binary for bytes
[20:40] isaacs: japj: yeah
[20:40] isaacs: japj: just pick something :)
[20:40] isaacs: japj: email the list.  we'll pick it apart :)
[20:40] kartmetal: SubStack, this https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy ?
[20:40] isaacs: beat it up, simmer it a little.
[20:40] isaacs: it's not a trivial feature.
[20:40] jerrysv: intel_ix: and just for the stupid question, your max memory size is unlimited?
[20:40] unomi has joined the channel
[20:40] SubStack: kartmetal: actually https://github.com/substack/node-binary
[20:40] SubStack: for byte-level stuff
[20:40] isaacs: japj: also, the trick is to make it easy enough that anyone will actually use it.
[20:41] SubStack: kartmetal: binary(stream).buffer('x', 10).tap(function (vars) { console.log(vars.x) })
[20:41] kartmetal: oh nice.
[20:41] Intel_iX: seems to be a memory limit though: > var a = []; var i = 100; while (i--) { a.push(new Buffer(100000000)); console.log(i); } \n 99 \n 98 \n 97 \n 96 \n 95 \n 94 \n terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
[20:41] Intel_iX: No, but the idea is that it pages.
[20:41] SubStack: will print the first 10 bytes from stream no matter how the data buffers get broken up
[20:41] Intel_iX: And uses a swapfile.
[20:41] jerrysv: intel_ix: um. ulimit -a 
[20:42] Intel_iX: ulimit is for node, compile or what?
[20:42] Intel_iX: compiler
[20:42] jerrysv: intel_ix: process
[20:42] japj: isaacs: true but it's also about (possible) root access needed to install packages (which is not what we want, but we could tell: if you want to use this package, please run "<packagetool> install <package>" and try again)

[20:43] slaskis: When I do a lot of http requests (pulling/pushing in a lot from an API) I keep getting 'Error: EADDRINUSE, Address already in use', why is that? It stops if I use agent.maxSockets = 1...but I'd like some concurrency
[20:44] Intel_iX: EADDRINUSE, port is in use
[20:44] Intel_iX: Try another port

[20:45] arzvi has joined the channel
[20:45] arzvi: is the reduce fuinction available in node.js? am using version 4.1
[20:45] Intel_iX: maybe something like: socket.on 'error', (e) -> if e is 'Error: EADDRINUSE, Address already in use' then socket.listen ++port
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: arzvi: that's v8
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: if you mean [].reduce
[20:46] arzvi: yah
[20:46] arzvi:  var a=arguments.reduce(function(a,b){ return a+b;},0);

[20:47] tjholowaychuk: it's a wtfjs
[20:47] mraleph: tjholowaychuk: \o/
[20:47] arzvi: ok it was yesterday that i got introduced to node.js
[20:47] arzvi: so to do this what should i do in node.js? 
[20:47] slaskis: Intel_iX: but it's not the server but the client...i can't start more servers...
[20:47] arzvi: just loop through the arguments
[20:47] arzvi: ?
[20:47] arzvi: is it an array?
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: or [].slice.call(arguments).reduce
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: (that converts it to an array)
[20:48] arzvi: what is 'arguments'?
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: the arguments object
[20:48] mraleph: arguments is arguments object 
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: that you were just talking about
[20:48] hybsch has joined the channel
[20:48] jacobolus has joined the channel

[20:56] jerrysv: intel_ix: oh, you're on windows. um.
[20:56] arzvi: so v8 has arguments as array while node.js has it as oject
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: node isn't a language
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: it's just on top of v8, that's a regular v8 Arguments object
[20:56] arzvi: gotcha
[20:57] arzvi: i was just listening to Crockford on javascript 
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: node doesn't extend the language or anything like that
[20:57] arzvi: and he pasted using arguments.reduce
[20:57] alessio_alex: :P
[20:57] arzvi: so wanted to try that
[20:57] mustakes has joined the channel
[20:58] arzvi: is that wrong even in v8? 
[20:58] kmiyashiro: does Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) only work because slice returns an array?
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: v8 implements a slow case for array-ish type things
[20:59] arzvi: i tried [].slice,call(arguments) -> works fine
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[20:59] mraleph: Array.prototype.foo methods are intentionally specified to be generic so they could work on any object that quacks like Array (has length and can be indexed)
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: same thing

[21:02] techwraith: kmiyashiro: Kue
[21:02] techwraith: https://github.com/LearnBoost/kue
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: techwraith im going to implement it so that only the jobs within the window are polling
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: so if you have like 50k jobs
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: it's still fine
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: but i need to figure out how to get browsers to not hate on the scrollbars

[21:04] tjholowaychuk: when you get 10k jobs a second
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: let me know

[22:05] jesusabdullah: Oh, and mikeal, I was serious about needing to borrow a phone. The tracfone people insist I need a third phone to transfer my number to my new phone. Pisses me off!
[22:05] jesusabdullah: Just throwing that out there <_>
[22:06] Nexxy: tracphones are for drug dealers

[22:24] kartmetal: understood, but some protocols start with a little bit of binary back and forth, followed by a whole lot of bulk data that doesn't need parsing.
[22:24] kartmetal: like, SOCKS.
[22:24] SubStack: as I said

[22:27] SubStack: kartmetal: you tell it to stop implicitly by letting it run out of stuff to do
[22:27] SubStack: which is to say you don't do anything at all
[22:27] kartmetal: right. except it's still hook to "data" events, and it's still pushing Buffer object dutifully in an ever-growing array.
[22:28] kartmetal: presumably, because I might decide I cared about all that data down the line. Which is legit, just not ideal here.
[22:29] kartmetal: I could run some variation of (function lame() { this.flush().skip(65536).tap(lame); }).call(this); to keep the memory use in check, but that feels weird.
[22:29] SubStack: kartmetal: you could send a pull req to fix it if it starts becoming a problem
[22:30] SubStack: or just stream.removeAllListeners('data')
[22:30] kartmetal: ooh.

[23:09] Aria has joined the channel
[23:09] killfill: bnoordhuis, its showing some net output.. but not the http one. :S
[23:09] xeodox: what makes soda better than tobi (hence you use it more)?
[23:09] rfay has joined the channel
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: it uses selenium
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: so we can test with saucelabs in say 5 or 6 browsers
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: instead of headless
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: which is more important for acceptance tests
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: the real deal
[23:09] bnoordhuis: killfill: maybe use `node debug app.js` to step through it?
[23:10] jmoyers: ffffuuuuuu
[23:10] jmoyers: i HATE cygwin
[23:10] jmoyers: and i hate mingw
[23:10] jmoyers: that is all
[23:11] xeodox: What is headless testing?
[23:11] jmoyers: browserless
[23:11] jmoyers: selenium = virtualized browsers
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: tobi is "headless"
[23:11] jmoyers: headless is simulating, usually, with something like jsdom
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: and zombie too
[23:12] killfill: ooh its like gdb?.. ooh gdb wanst my friend..
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: less useful
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: but faster if you want to run tests often
[23:12] jmoyers: phantomjs looked interesting
[23:12] killfill: "program terminated" <-- cannot bt or something like that
[23:12] jmoyers: though i haven't tried it -- a real webkit instance seems like a nice way around the cajillion problems trying to simulate everything
[23:12] Lorentz_: I use selenium too, as well as headless testing
[23:13] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: How good of integration test coverage do you guys have?
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: not enough right now
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: but our selenium tests take a good 15 minnutes or so to run

[23:14] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: We might look into using soda though

[23:14] tjholowaychuk: yeah. you more or less NEED acceptance tests in real browsers
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: so i find the other stuff
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: slightly useless
[23:14] techwraith: Also, shameless plug ;) - https://www.yammer.com/jobs
[23:15] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: are functional tests more important than unit tests?
[23:16] jmoyers: am using soda myself, its a nice package
[23:16] jmoyers: ACTION thanks tj
[23:16] bnoordhuis: techwraith: what does yammer do with node?
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: unit level is what people screw up the most
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: so i think that's important
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: and then real browser testing is important
[23:16] techwraith: All of our uploads go through a node service
[23:16] felixge: SubStack: want patch so line 8 isn't needed? https://gist.github.com/9f63feebe6b1410aa120

[23:21] jmoyers: cant say they are totally non-evil
[23:21] isaacs: if your automatic payment doesn't go through, they don't tell you.  they just randomly assign your DNS to point at their google adsense farm.
