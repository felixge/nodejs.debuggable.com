[00:05] tjholowaychuk: haven't touched ruby in ages
[00:05] zmbmartin: That looks right but with 1.8.7 you need to require 'rubygems' first

[00:22] tjholowaychuk: grr
[00:22] hachque: i'm working on an implementation of Node.js under .NET and i need to know, given that ReadableStream is asynchronous, how are OnData events handled when there's no handler attached (i.e. events that fire between the creation of the ReadableStream and the .on('data', ...) call)
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: IronNode?
[00:23] hachque: does it act as if it's paused and that the read events are simply all passed to the OnData event as soon as it's assigned?

[00:24] kohai: @kevingc: getting started with node.js on heroku!
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: you just listen on 'data'

[00:25] tjholowaychuk: you have a tick to listen
[00:25] webben has joined the channel
[00:25] hachque: not sure i understand there; doesn't the async request start when fs.open is called?
[00:26] tjholowaychuk: you wont receive data events until the next tick (or more) but when it v8 hits that a.on('data' call
[00:26] tjholowaychuk: no data events will have been emitted
[00:26] hachque: you see in .NET there are asynchronous reads are happening between fs.open() and file.on('data', ...);

[00:27] hachque: in that case i'll set it's initial state to paused
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: sounds busted
[00:27] hachque: and then when it finishes executing the initial JS statements
[00:27] hachque: it'll set them all to unpaused
[00:27] webben has joined the channel
[00:28] hachque: is one tick one statement, or is one tick after all the initial statements are done and node.js goes into it's main loop?
[00:29] hachque: tjholowaychuk: ?
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: no it's not one statement

[02:07] marshall: hey node
[02:07] marshall: anybody have experience with siege?
[02:07] webben has joined the channel
[02:08] ale_: digiwano: http://pastebin.com/vDbxvy1J
[02:08] ale_: digiwano: which url should I access?
[02:08] marshall: I hooked up hummingbird with one of my apps, I want to simulate a ton of traffic hitting the server but I can't seem to get siege to download the tracking pixel when it visits the page
[02:09] brraaains: you can't embed node.js code in html like that can you? that doesnt really make sense
[02:09] brraaains: referring to ale_'s code
[02:09] digiwano: ale_: node doesnt run in the browser
[02:10] ale_: And how can I make it work?
[02:10] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: did you get your gems figured out?
[02:10] digiwano: create a new file named whatever.js, paste the example into that, run it on the commandline with node wahtever.js
[02:10] webben has joined the channel
[02:10] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin nah gave up and started working on other stuff for now
[02:10] ale_: but if I want to make a webapp is it impossible?!
[02:10] brraaains: lol no ale_:
[02:10] ale_: sorry, I am fully new to this!
[02:11] brraaains: you have to think of node.js as a server side language like php
[02:11] digiwano: ale_: it wouldnt make much sense, node is the serverside-part
[02:11] marshall: digiwano: that wouldn't let him interact with it
[02:11] digiwano: marshall: why not?
[02:11] ale_: So nodejs produces a hight amount of bandwidth??
[02:12] marshall: digiwano: when node isn't waiting for anything, like listen(), it finishes and exits
[02:12] webben has joined the channel
[02:12] digiwano: marshall: but theres a .listen() in his code, its the straight up most vanilla example thats on the node.js main page?
[02:13] marshall: digiwano: oh, then yeah
[02:13] digiwano: :)
[02:13] marshall: guys have any experience with web server benchmarking?
[02:13] brraaains: what are you trying to do with nodejs ale_?
[02:13] digiwano: seriously though im ready to start turning my simple example code into a real lib and poppin it up on npm or whatever
[02:13] digiwano: and im all sorts of held up on coming up with a goddamned name >_<
[02:13] marshall: what's it do?
[02:14] digiwano: its sort of like the nodejs repl, except not for repl
[02:14] ale_: brraaains: a multi-user chat
[02:15] webben has joined the channel
[02:15] brraaains: go to nodejs.org and look at their demo lol
[02:15] digiwano: if you replace the 'eval' in repl with 'whatever the hell you want to do in this step', thats what its for
[02:15] marshall: nodeline
[02:15] marshall: call it that

[02:16] marshall: Comrade
[02:16] digiwano: thats one of the reasons i dont like it
[02:16] marshall: sounds good
[02:16] digiwano: but i love comrade 
[02:16] ale_: brraaains: ?
[02:16] digiwano: thats perfect
[02:16] brraaains: define whiteboard

[02:18] halfhalo: run it with hammer!
[02:18] marshall: I could be a wood and nails developer
[02:18] digiwano: lo
[02:18] digiwano: l
[02:18] ale_: brraaains: I mean, doesn't matter, my doubt is how do I run it on web? 
[02:18] marshall: lol hammer would be the IDE
[02:18] brraaains: marshall: i'm sure some hipster programmer is already thinking about it lol
[02:18] marshall: hahaha
[02:19] marshall: you have to admit, nodejs is pretty hipster
[02:19] digiwano: ale_: generally you'd have a node.js server generating all the code, and html/js on the browser side to do the frontend work
[02:19] marshall: javascript is vintage
[02:19] marshall: in a new context
[02:19] marshall: and all the kids love it
[02:19] brraaains: nails and wood sounds like something some nyu guys thought of. kind of like diaspora. those kids just picked the most random name out of the book

[02:19] zmbmartin: ale_: read around there are plenty of examples out there.
[02:19] ale_: brraaains: Do you know a cheap hosting?
[02:20] marshall: What's a diaspora?
[02:20] brraaains: its a facebook clone
[02:20] marshall: ale_: nodester is free, try and get an invite for that
[02:20] brraaains: but more private and stuff
[02:20] brraaains: joindiaspora.com
[02:20] ale_: cool!
[02:20] marshall: is it full of rebels and hipsters?
[02:20] zmbmartin: ale_: what is cheap?
[02:20] mawkor2: diaspora sounds like a black metal band
[02:20] ale_: And last question...does node.js generate too much bandwidth?
[02:21] brraaains: marshall: probably lol, i dunno though. it got really popular when they first announced it and they got like 200,000 bucks from donators. mark zuckerberg even donated. but i haven't really heard much from them since it "released"

[02:25] sorens3n: can't stop the XSS in a tooltip... :(
[02:25] brraaains: marak: be afraid of the future programmers. i just graduated college and most of my peers lacked any motivation

[02:27] sorens3n: which is really, imo, all you need
[02:28] sorens3n: html/css/js/php/node i learned out of motivation
[02:28] sorens3n: school... meh
[02:28] tjholowaychuk: sorens3n agreed
[02:28] tjholowaychuk: i didnt go to school
[02:28] brraaains: soren3n: yeah, or being forced to learn something lol. in my first software engineering class my prof told us we had to make a website. so i learned php mysql html css all by myself
[02:28] blkcat: i studied greek and latin in college; didn't want to subject myself to a cs program ;)
[02:28] brraaains: it actually was a lot of fun

[02:29] mawkor2: and I was like 'this is crap'
[02:29] mawkor2: looking back I realize I was right
[02:29] sorens3n: i'm sure there are many low-level things that i'm missing 
[02:29] sorens3n: school taught c++/java/mASM
[02:29] sorens3n: which i never have made money on
[02:30] tjholowaychuk: i just wish i had taken a few years off as my "schooling" and read some good books
[02:30] brraaains: sorens3n: it really depends, computer science and programming are 2 different ball games. take an algorithms class and see how little programming you do lol
[02:30] sorens3n: and i really did love school
[02:30] sorens3n: but i'm poor and needed money
[02:30] sorens3n: lol
[02:30] mawkor2: yah i loved those classes
[02:30] mawkor2: but Im a math major
[02:30] sorens3n: assembly was mad fun
[02:30] mawkor2: math is way more interesting
[02:30] sorens3n: i slept all class however, somehow had the highest grade
[02:30] marshall: algorithms and design patterns, I wish I'd learned those in school

[02:34] sorens3n: works for me, learning python/django at the moment
[02:34] mawkor2: you have to spend like 10 years in acedemia to make something of a math degree though
[02:34] sorens3n: yea, f that
[02:35] sorens3n: i been doin html/css since i was 14

[02:39] sorens3n: lol i'm with you on that
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: besides! never say never, I was a designer most my life lol programming is more of a recent thing
[02:40] sorens3n: thats amazing actually
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: probably about half my career thus far was design work
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: lately like 1%

[02:41] tbranyen: perl :-/
[02:41] brraaains: i like php. at least when i first used it i thought it was amazing
[02:42] sorens3n: haha, i started with php as well
[02:42] sorens3n: i was working on Kohana when i finally quit the job to do pure node.js work

[02:45] sorens3n: thanks marak

[02:45] webben has joined the channel
[02:45] Marak: sorens3n: how so?
[02:45] sorens3n: can anyone tell me the point of stylus? or less?
[02:45] sorens3n: marak: like a music channel
[02:46] Marak: sorens3n: lol, awesome
[02:46] sorens3n: and have it pub/subbed to that chan, with maybe admin controls
[02:46] Marak: sorens3n: you doing any of this open-source?
[02:46] tbranyen: sorens3n: write a lot of css and you'll see the point very quickly
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: sorens3n defining all vendor gradient syntaxes and node-canvas generated fallback image in a single property :p
[02:46] sorens3n: well, i started off doing the whole thing open source
[02:46] tbranyen: partials... variables... single line m*f*ing comments
[02:46] sorens3n: but, then i thought i might try and make some cash from it
[02:46] sorens3n: any thoughts?
[02:47] sorens3n: tj: i write a TON of css, its already built to be cascading, so i never understood another API on top
[02:47] sorens3n: just combine classes or declarations?
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: like i said, you can have a much more concise document
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: for example
[02:47] sorens3n: using variables in CSS will probably just create more code in the end, imho, but i've never gotten on board
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: with stylus "absolute: top left" vs three props
[02:48] webben has joined the channel
[02:48] sorens3n: ah, i see
[02:48] sorens3n: you did sell me on jade....
[02:48] sorens3n: is stylus yours?
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[02:48] sorens3n: i was considering less if anything else
[02:48] sorens3n: i might do some stylus
[02:48] sorens3n: i'm just crazy at CSS so i have no need
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: out of less/stylus/sass less is definitely the least feature-rich
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: with the one benefit of being light enough to run in the browser
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: which IMO is a bad idea anyway
[02:49] sorens3n: ah, good to know, it was the first one i found
[02:49] chjj: thats probably why i would go with less^
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: if you use LESS in the browser, chances are it's for a tiny site, otherwise you would care more, and if it's a tiny site, you most likely don't need such a tool
[02:49] hachque: does anyone know whether there's a specific maximum length to the strings passed to an onData event? or whether the onData event returns lines at a time for files, etc.?
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: the one exception I've seen, is how devseed uses it for their mapping tool
[02:49] chjj: didnt mean in browser
[02:50] brraaains: tjholowaychuk: its funny you said you were more of a designer until recently, cause honestly, stuff like jade and stylus seem like its more geared to a programmer and not a designer imo
[02:50] chjj: but i do think thats a novel idea

[02:50] tjholowaychuk: we just want stuff that can help us get things done faster

[03:49] brraaains: thats how i am with a lot of prog languages
[03:49] digiwano: where its only half fp/ half oo

[04:04] mawkor2: is memory the bottleneck?

[04:54] webben has joined the channel
[04:55] digiwano: i get self-conscious about my code though, silly as it is
[04:55] digiwano: which in its extremes only causes me to overengineer things
[04:56] BlackFate has joined the channel
[04:56] brraaains: i think a lot of people are that way. my code is always hideous. and i feel so guilty when i dont comment my code. cause im always thinking to myself: "but i know what that does... i dont need a comment there"
[04:57] notgeorge has left the channel
[04:57] webben has joined the channel
[04:57] brraaains: well my code isnt hideous. i just think others might think it is
[04:58] SubStack: I prefer underengineering
[04:58] SubStack: haha comments
[04:58] SubStack: I pretty much never write comments >_<
[04:58] digiwano: comments are an admission that you can't write expressive code
[04:58] Aria: Me either.
[04:58] SubStack: digiwano: I know right?
[04:59] brraaains: haha yeah thats a good point digiwano. i feel like my code explains itself
[04:59] brraaains: cause it does lol
[04:59] digiwano: as it should
[04:59] SubStack: test coverage > comments
[04:59] webben has joined the channel
[04:59] SubStack: tests > docs > comments
[05:00] digiwano: plus comments are the first thing to get out of date and the easiest thing to let slip by because they're out of date
[05:00] brraaains: im pretty particular about my code too. i converted some guys code from c++ to java for the fact that i couldnt stand looking at his awfully formatted code. java on the other hand almost makes it a requirement to write neat code. as long as you stick to the standards
[05:01] brraaains: i.e., camel case, getters, setters, etc

[05:02] jerrysv: comments are not necessarily an admission that you can't write expressive code
[05:02] jerrysv: sometimes, when trying to preserve some essence of an algorithm that may be foreign, or some specific business logic, they are needed
[05:02] digiwano: oh sure absolutely
[05:03] jerrysv: leaving a note about a specific implementation of a levenshtein distance ...

[05:03] Aria: I think the most recent comments I wrote were the details of the adoption-agency algorithm in the HTML5 parser.

[05:03] jerrysv: algorithm in the parser? wut?
[05:04] webben has joined the channel
[05:04] Aria: If you misnest certain tags, the HTML5 parser has a long, detailed, specific way to reparent them so that they make sense.

[08:57] digiwano: file access is like a bolted on plugin to async.js
[08:58] digiwano: it's primary thing is super extensible async functional-programming-style function composition :3
[08:58] jetienne: they should work on their subtitle :)
[08:58] digiwano: the file access stuff is cool but its an addon and you can easily replace it or implement an interface similar to the builtin file-access thing

[09:07] liar has joined the channel
[09:08] SubStack: papandreou: yes this would be a breaking change
[09:08] SubStack: I would just assume have Seq() take an array for a breaking change
[09:08] SubStack: since I Seq.ap() all over
[09:09] papandreou: SubStack: Oh, so Seq(...) uses .set(...) internally?
[09:09] kohai: @imm0use: На секции про django рассказывали об интеграции с node.js и tornado
[09:09] SubStack: no they both just update the stack
[09:10] SubStack: but this is a breaking change because old code that uses set() will not work
[09:10] SubStack: so I might as well change some other stuff
[09:10] papandreou: SubStack: Or the docs :)
[09:10] samyak: what are the flow control modules one would recommend for working with node.js
[09:10] matjas has joined the channel
[09:10] papandreou: SubStack: My original issue was that the docs said the wrong thing.

[09:10] SubStack: papandreou: the docs were wrong then
[09:10] SubStack: tests > docs
[09:11] papandreou: SubStack: The two other commits are unrelated, I added them because you can only have one pull req at a time.
[09:11] kohai: @imm0use: Интеграция с node.js нужна для делегирования ему таких штук, как, к примеру, чатик. Интеграция с tornado - для использования там django.
[09:12] papandreou: SubStack: Would you be opposed to add another function for replacing the entire stack with an array then?
[09:12] towski has joined the channel
[09:13] SubStack: you could .empty().extend(xs)
[09:13] papandreou: SubStack: I've found that to be more useful than what .set() currently doesa
[09:13] SubStack: yeah I don't like how set presently works either
[09:13] SubStack: but Seq() is the same way
[09:13] papandreou: SubStack: Yeah, that's what I'm doing now.
[09:13] SubStack: looks at arguments instead of expecting an array
[09:14] papandreou: SubStack: Right... So that's the other breaking change you'd be tempted to do at the same time :)
[09:14] SubStack: yes
[09:14] papandreou: SubStack: No objections from me. Thanks for taking a look.

[09:21] papandreou: samyak: I can certainly recommend node-seq. I've used it in a big project, even in some heavily nested constructs. My experience is that it has exactly the features I need.
[09:22] papandreou: samyak: Even concurrency limit, which none of the other libs supported when I checked them out. That's pretty useful when eg. you need to read hundreds of files from disc.
[09:23] SubStack: ^_^
[09:23] samyak: SubStack, howdy ?
[09:23] SubStack: was planning on having a rate-based concurrency limit at some point too
[09:23] SubStack: samyak: oh hello
[09:24] papandreou: SubStack: How would that work?
[09:24] samyak: I am creating a production app ... to be on ec2 
[09:24] SubStack: papandreou: for external apis
[09:24] samyak: will be using mongodb with millions of documents !! :P

[09:29] alessio_alex: I am trying to show the iostats for my Ubuntu with node
[09:29] alessio_alex: http://pastie.org/2017575
[09:29] alessio_alex: however, it works sometimes and sometimes not
[09:30] alessio_alex: for example in Firefox it works once every 2 refreshes
[09:30] alessio_alex: in Chrome doesn't work at all
[09:30] alessio_alex: with curl works all the time
[09:30] alessio_alex: Help
[09:30] kohai: @NetRoY: first i thought of node.js bindings for solr ... & then i thought what a stupid idea .... its json all the way.
[09:30] papandreou: SubStack: And maybe a "pipeline" mode where you can add more items to the stack later, e.g. when traversing a tree asynchronously. But that's probably better suited for a separate module.
[09:30] SubStack: async mode for traverse
[09:31] SubStack: papandreou: you can submit a pull req for my traverse module
[09:31] kohai: @NetRoY: so apparently our beloved @nodekohai & @kohaiTestBot have escaped from the IRC land to spam twitter too .. u mention node & they'll follow u
[09:31] papandreou: SubStack: Actually haven't checked that one out yet, but I will, thanks :)
[09:32] SubStack: although I haven't run into any cases where I'd want to do a data transformation asynchronously
[09:33] SubStack: since those tasks tend to be side-effect free

[09:48] huge: http://pastie.org/2017617 I got confused in my example
[09:49] mscdex: huge: i think you want fs.open(), not file.open
[09:49] huge: If I would like to open a file(path) and read all contents, is it correct in my above code sample?
[09:49] huge: oops..
[09:49] mscdex: huge: and `status` is the error argument
[09:50] mscdex: huge: do you want to read the file in chunk by chunk or all at once?
[09:50] huge: both works to me
[09:51] mscdex: huge: well for streaming, you could use fs.createReadStream() or use fs.readFile() to read buffer the whole file
[09:52] mscdex: huge: if you're just redirecting the file contents to another stream, like an http connection, you can simply do fs.createReadStream('foo.txt').pipe(http_response);
[09:52] mscdex: :)

[10:46] papandreou: SubStack: Running into some problems after upgrading from seq 0.2.1 to 0.3.0. Looks like an infinite loop in traverse.map => walk => walker where it's plowing through all the objects in my stack.

[10:47] SubStack: papandreou: in traverse or seq?
[10:47] papandreou: papandreou: seq which uses chainsaw which uses traverse

[10:48] SubStack: papandreou: can you get the tests to run?
[10:49] papandreou: SubStack: Yes, the seq tests run fine, it's the tests of my own code that's failing after I upgrade.
[10:50] papandreou: SubStack: It's a simple Seq([complex object holding refs to a lot of other objects]).parEach(function (obj) {...}) that never makes it into the parEach function.

[14:09] syskk: mscdex: yes, but lazy loading usually implies an I/O operation with a database, so the developer would need to provide a callback. which makes lazy loading pretty useless... the point of lazy loading in an ORM is that the developer doesn't have to worry about what to load from the DB upfront
[14:09] jtsnow has joined the channel

[14:13] syskk: let's say you have a book object with an author property, book.author shouldn't be loaded from the db until it is actually used, that's what I mean by lazy loading. this isn't really possible with Node.js
[14:14] syskk: you have to explicitly load it from the db

[14:21] brimster has joined the channel
[14:23] ryah: Wizek: don't make them really private
[14:23] ryah: Wizek: just put an underscore or something in front to suggest they are private
[14:23] ckknight: Wizek: either don't make them private or, what I prefer, is to test the external, public API
[14:25] ckknight: I'm not a big fan of testing the private internals because if you do an internal refactor, as long as the public API tests pass, it's all good. Also, you should try to be modular enough so that not too much magic is being done in the background
[14:25] Wizek: ckknight, but then, aren't you baffled when you write something quite big, and you can only test the whole to see wheter it passes (sometimes with false positives maybe), or fails as a whole not indicating well where the error might be?
[14:26] ckknight: Wizek: true, but I generally try to architect things so I don't get into that case
[14:26] Wizek: ryah, yep, I tought the same. Maybe there is a reason for JS missing public and private keywords :)
[14:27] Wizek: ckknight, In what way do you architect then?
[14:27] baudehlo: "Maybe there is a reason for JS missing public and private keywords" - yes because they are a straight jacket that you don't really need.
[14:28] ckknight: Wizek: although it's quite tough, I generally try to expose as little as possible, which allows for stronger modularity and more of a capability-oriented programming style. I test how things perform, not necessarily what individual getters return (and such)

[14:33] Wizek: ckknight, HTML based? It's more like JS based, but yeah, it manipulates the dom
[14:34] ckknight: syskk: yeah, just runInNewContext and don't pass in require
[14:35] ckknight: Wizek: basically my approach is outside-in. Take the outermost input (in your case, user action such as typing stuff or clicking) and then look at the resultant outermost output (a dialog box pops up or what have you)

[15:11] tmedema: it's in the ML
[15:12] mscdex: well, i mean it sends a FIN TCP packet
[15:12] mscdex: which indicates the connection is closed
[15:12] RORgasm has joined the channel
[15:12] tmedema: mscdex: and what if the receiving end does not adhere to that message?
[15:13] mscdex: then it'll have issues for sure :)
[15:13] mscdex: i don't think node does half closed TCP connections by default anymore
[15:14] tmedema: mscdex: well in that case, ending with res.end and not checking afterwards is not " the proper way " as far as my intelligence goes
[15:14] mscdex: checking for what?
[15:15] tmedema: mscdex: checking if the connection is actually destroyed 
[15:15] marshall has joined the channel
[15:15] mscdex: it will be closed
[15:15] tmedema: mscdex: oh so it is guaranteed? I must have misinterpreted your previous answer
[15:16] ceej: domsz: you around?  a few of us last night were trying to get the current mouse angles not matter what position you were in the map http://screencast.com/t/uuFurbut Cracker2 came up with https://gist.github.com/a1de4e9e4efb24422a09 but there seems to be a bug
[15:16] mscdex: i mean, if node has told the other end it's no longer connected, then the connection is severed
[15:16] tmedema: mscdex: I thought that you meant that, if the client does not adhere to the FIN packet, there will be issues in that the connection will not be properly closed
[15:17] tmedema: I've had issues in my app that appear to get resolved by substituting req.connection.destroy for res.end, even though there is nothing in the writing buffer left as far as I know - I am under the suspicion that this connection is also not closed when the client is busy sending data to the server,  rather than the other way around
[15:17] boehm has joined the channel
[15:17] mscdex: if the client doesn't adhere to the FIN packet, something is wrong with their TCP implementation
[15:18] tmedema: mscdex: true, but that is of no importance to me
[15:18] mscdex: heh
[15:18] mscdex: right, so use res.end() and you should be fine :)
[15:18] ceej: anyone else have any ideas?
[15:18] kool has joined the channel
[15:18] tmedema: mscdex: really? even if the client has a wrongly implemented the TCP transport?
[15:19] mscdex: tmedema: yes, really.
[15:19] tmedema: mscdex: alright, great, do you happen to know what might cause the issue I described above?
[15:20] tmedema: the client keeps sending data it seems, while the server has no data left to send -- and yet the server does not close the connection with res.end

[15:31] mscdex: tmedema: i dunno then
[15:32] mscdex: tmedema: what client is this?
[15:32] tmedema: mscdex: it's a flash multipart uploader
[15:32] mscdex: tmedema: and what are you using on the node side for handling that?
[15:33] tmedema: mscdex: just an express server with node-formidable
[15:34] tmedema: app.post('/fileInputStream', function(req, res) { .... //if something goes wrong, I use res.end(); which does not seem to close the connection when the client is busy sending data, while req.connection.destroy() does even though the writing buffer is empty as far as I know }
[15:34] mscdex: tmedema: i guess one way to test to if it's something to do with node-formidable, is to just write a plain tcp client and server where the client keeps sending (random) data continuously and then call connection.end() on the server some time after the client connects and sends data
[15:35] mscdex: and see what happens
[15:35] tmedema: mscdex: yes, I guess I should try that - also, is there a way to check if the writing buffer is empty or not at a certain moment?
[15:35] tmedema: it might be stuck trying to send headers I did not specify or something weird

[15:37] mscdex: tmedema: i guess you'd peer into the net.js code to see what the "private" variable name is for the write queue
[15:38] ryanfitz has joined the channel

[22:23] halfhalo: someone needs to go make me a control module for directv dvr's
[22:23] baudehlo: node core just uses function Blah () { ... }  var blah_instance = new Blah();
[22:24] baudehlo: I don't see what you need a wrapper around that for.
[22:26] baudehlo: but then I'm new to Javascript, so maybe there's some magic I'm unaware of.

[22:40] Aria: Also, property definition.
[22:40] baudehlo: so barely ever then :)
[22:40] jhurliman: very handy library
[22:41] baudehlo: yeah I wish node had something like that built in.
[22:41] baudehlo: though 0.5 has some stuff in Buffer now.

[23:26] TheDahv: But that's good to know. Future iterations of one of my projects will require web sockets
[23:26] TheDahv: socket.io won't 'fake it' until heroku does though?
[23:26] TheDahv: ACTION assumes you're using socket.io...oops
[23:26] mwhooker: well... theoretically it can fall back to jsonp or something
[23:26] mwhooker: I am using socket.io, thankfully

[23:28] TheDahv: ...install the packages globally
[23:29] radicality has joined the channel
[23:29] mwhooker: that doesn't seem right
[23:29] jonaslund has joined the channel
[23:29] mwhooker: I'm checking out joyentcloud now
[23:30] radicality: using socket.io + node, how can I send a message to a specific client. this is probably a very basic question, but I can't figure it out :S
[23:31] aliem has joined the channel
[23:31] mwhooker: radicality: when the client connects you'll get a handle to the client
[23:31] TheDahv: mwhooker: Which doesn't seem right? The setup or my approach?
[23:31] mwhooker: TheDahv: installing the packages globally
[23:31] radicality: mwhooker: ok, and then when I have that handle, I just call 'send' on it ?
[23:32] mwhooker: radicality: yup
[23:33] TheDahv: mwhooker: fair enough, I get that. The preferred method is to install the packages locally
[23:33] TheDahv: I wonder if it's going to create a new folder for each release I publish
[23:33] TheDahv: In which case the packages would need to be there *somehow*
[23:33] TheDahv: And if it isn't global, then maybe there needs to be some kind of commit hook
[23:34] TheDahv: I tried tweeting @joyent. Maybe they have an answer
[23:34] igl1 has joined the channel
[23:34] TheDahv: Oh, just found some documentation. Maybe there's an answer there
[23:34] mwhooker: TheDahv: is there a folder with the name of your project?
[23:35] nornagon_ has joined the channel
[23:36] TheDahv: clear
[23:36] TheDahv: oops
[23:36] TheDahv: ha
[23:36] TheDahv: wrong window
[23:36] TheDahv: no, just "node-service" and "repo"
[23:36] TheDahv: plus a "local" folder for bins
[23:36] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:36] radicality: mwhooker: ok, but isnt' that 'client' object this massive thing? can I just send to a client using a sessionID or something ? or should I keep that all the 'client' objects in some array ?
[23:37] mwhooker: radicality: I don't think it's big enough to worry about. just some data to identify a connection
[23:38] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[23:38] mwhooker: radicality: but to be honest, I've never done this at scale
[23:38] sjbreen has joined the channel
[23:38] TheDahv: mwhooker: "node-services" contains a releases folder with a folder named by timestamp for each accepted push
[23:39] TheDahv: The first push was accepted because my application file was named "app.js". no.de looks for "server.js", so it accepted the push, but didn't run the application
[23:39] mwhooker: ah
[23:39] hasenj has joined the channel
[23:40] mwhooker: oh damn, I need a coupon code
[23:40] TheDahv: I did a git rename and pushed again
[23:40] TheDahv: But now it's mad because it can't run the application because it can't find the express module etc...
[23:40] mwhooker: you've got a package.json?
[23:40] TheDahv: I do
[23:41] TheDahv: Heroku must have an automatic hook that looks for the package file and runs the install command
[23:41] mwhooker: radicality: it seems rare that you'd need to hold a client object for very long. want to talk a bit more about what you're trying to do?
[23:41] TheDahv: no.de does not
[23:41] mwhooker: TheDahv: heroku does it on git push
[23:42] sjbreen has joined the channel
[23:42] radicality: mwhooker: i'm just trying to send a message to a specific client. I have a messaging system (send a message to another user), and I want a real-time notification of a new-message if the other user is also logged in
[23:42] mwhooker: ah
[23:42] mwhooker: yeah, I'd create some sort of lookup table, like user_id -> client object

[23:44] TheDahv: ahhh, I gotta deal with Verizon. brb

[23:49] TheDahv: mwhooker: That's a bummer heroku doesn't do sockets. Nor does it do the right version of node.js
[23:49] mwhooker: really? what's up with the version?
[23:50] a2800276 has joined the channel
[23:50] TheDahv: It blew up in a terrific fashion since one of my apps used connect-mongodb
[23:51] TheDahv: There's an issue out there. Let me look
[23:51] mwhooker: hmmm
[23:51] kris_will: does the package.json for mongodb have a  "engine": "node >= 0.4.1"
[23:51] kris_will: or something similar?
[23:52] _aron has joined the channel
[23:52] sudhirjonathan has joined the channel
[23:52] kris_will: looks like 0.4.0
[23:53] MrNibbles has joined the channel
[23:53] kris_will: heroku's Cedar slice supports node 0.4.7
[23:55] TheDahv: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/npm-/833CXXdNCcM/discussion
[23:55] TheDahv: "Bug Heroku to upgrade their npm installation to 1.0.7."
[23:56] TheDahv: Soo, back to my original issue, I can't publish my app on no.de because it doesn't have the packages installed. I can't install them before pushing because the repo isn't available for me to install them
[23:56] TheDahv: So, looks like I should just drink beer for a while
[23:57] mwhooker: heh
[23:57] mwhooker: what does npm install <project name> from your home directory do?
[23:57] TheDahv: 404 not found
[23:57] kris_will: so the real issue is npm, and heroku not being up to date with 108
[23:58] TheDahv: There is no folder called 'project_name' in home
[23:58] mwhooker: hmm
[23:58] TheDahv: it's renamed by the timestamp in /node-service/releases
[23:59] TheDahv: wait, does 'npm install' in a folder with 'package.json' in it look up the contents of that file and install from there?
[23:59] s00pcan has joined the channel
[23:59] kris_will: you need to .gitignore << node_modules
