[02:29] Brandon_R: box2dc++

[03:04] khrome has joined the channel
[03:04] Harzilein: denom: unstable has 0.6.12
[03:04] timoxley: denom most people have moved to 0.6.x AFAIK
[03:05] timoxley: Harzilein 0.6.13
[03:05] timoxley: and it's stable.
[03:05] Harzilein: timoxley: you should read the question before critizising my answer
[03:05] timoxley: Harzilein actually 0.6.14
[03:05] Harzilein: timoxley: you should read the question before critizising my answer
[03:06] polardude: panchot: I want to access my user object in my views to retrieve additional params
[03:06] timoxley: Harzilein what.
[03:06] ybit: i've got a paths issue
[03:06] ybit: Error: Cannot find module '/user/local/bin/node.io'
[03:06] Lorentz: there's nothing wrong with deploying latest node on debian stable, right
[03:06] polardude: panchot: that I set in ExtraParams
[03:06] ybit: the test.js file only contains nodeio = require("node.io")
[03:06] Harzilein: timoxley: he was asking about node versions in debian. debian stable has 0.4.12, debian unstable has 0.6.12
[03:06] polardude: panchot: only the id can be retrieved
[03:07] ybit: i even tried nodio = require("/usr/local/bin/node.io"
[03:07] timoxley: Harzilein sorry, I may have missed first line of question.
[03:07] timoxley: ybit is it really looking in /user not /usr

[03:09] Harzilein: do you know of a good website with examples _or a good book_ that covers accumulating the results of a number of asynchronous calls and calling a callback when all are finished?
[03:09] polardude: panchot: namely, "everyauth.user.name.first"?
[03:09] ybit: timoxley: thanks for catching that clumsy /user/ error :)
[03:09] Harzilein: so far i haven't found anything for what should be a common idiom
[03:09] astropirate: Harzilein, Async.js is your friend
[03:09] panchot: polardude: You can user everyauth.user
[03:10] panchot: polardude: But there is an alias called "user"
[03:10] polardude: panchot: "user.name.first"?
[03:10] panchot: polardude: So you can use user.name.first
[03:10] panchot: polardude: yep
[03:10] Harzilein: astropirate: i'll have a look, thanks.
[03:10] polardude: panchot: let me pastebin something
[03:10] polardude: g
[03:11] timoxley: Harzilein +1 to astropirate's suggestion. something like async's .map() or .parallel() will cure what ails you

[06:36] Swaagie has joined the channel

[06:42] TheAlphaNerd: maybe I misunderstood what you wanted to do
[06:42] Octayn: But you can't pass javascript to be executed
[06:42] TheAlphaNerd: do you want to execute multiple scripts?
[06:42] TheAlphaNerd: or could you have node running as a js serer
[06:43] BombStrike: if you are very courageous, you could use PLY (Pyton Lex-Yacc) and write your own interpreter :D
[06:43] sinclair: i want to target appengine
[06:43] sinclair: yeah, not really interested in writing my own interpreter, far too much work
[06:43] Octayn: TheAlphaNerd: OSC looks like it has a pretty narrow domain. Wouldn't just http or zeromq be better suited?
[06:44] Paul__ has joined the channel
[06:44] TheAlphaNerd: Octayn: with something like osc you are sending control messages mostly

[06:44] TheAlphaNerd: as it sounds
[06:44] sinclair: i need logic, not data
[06:45] TheAlphaNerd: what are you working on?
[06:45] sinclair: that's the thing about Python, it cannot be sandboxed (but it can be dynamically loaded in)
[06:45] Octayn: Python sure can be sandboxed, what are you talking about.
[06:45] sinclair: Octayn: how can i run python script with minimum trust?
[06:46] sinclair: from Python
[06:46] hipsterslapfight has joined the channel
[06:46] Octayn: sinclair: Spawn a child process and sandbox the syscalls with ptrace.
[06:46] sinclair: [domain [full trust]] -> loads -> [domain[minimum trust]]

[10:28] Cheery: I remember we had discussion that the user scripts could be stored in different domain.. which would limit them out from user info.

[10:31] Cheery: http://boxbase.org/ether/ <- anyway I did this while ago.
[10:32] fivetwentysix: Cheery: hmm?
[10:33] fivetwentysix: just wondering what the tdd tools are good to start with
[10:33] Cheery: my plan is to make those scripts such that the apps using them update automaticly whenever someone 'saves' the related file.
[10:33] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[10:33] Cheery: with collaborative editor I think it'll become good for teaching things out.
[10:34] Cheery: or just for writing games for sake of it.
[10:34] Cheery: problems in developing good games is that they need lot of tuning.
[10:35] Cheery: and they have that social kick.. people want to make games. :)
[10:35] Cheery: not just consume them.
[10:35] dotmariusz: fivetwentysix, I used Mocha, worked well.
[10:36] maritz: fivetwentysix: mocha nodeunit jasmine zombie tobi... there's tons of them, it pretty much boils down to personal preference and what fits your task best. (zombie and tobi are more for frontend tests, nodeunit is rather basic but does work in node.js and the browser, etc..)
[10:37] jetienne_: mocha is easy, works webbrowser and node.js, definitly worth a try

[11:11] literal_username: So I'm reading the child_processes documentation, and realizing customFds has been deprecated due to the fact that Windows can't support it, and naturally I think there goes f'ing Microsoft ruining everything again. So I google 'node.js windows', hoping to commiserate with millions of people complaining that node jumped the shark when Joyent got in bed with MS, but instead what I found was results upon results of how to us
[11:12] jploh has joined the channel
[11:13] Epeli: literal_username:  your message got sliced at "of how to us..."
[11:13] literal_username: Epeli: Thanks.
[11:13] literal_username: ... of how to use Node on Windows. I'm confused. Why would anyone in their right mind want to do that? Yes, I know this is flamebait. Just feeling irritated.
[11:14] pgte has joined the channel
[11:16] Epeli: The fact is that majority of (new) users are on Windows and it's lot easier for them to start with Node.js if is natively supported
[11:16] literal_username: I hear that. I understand the desire to make it more accesssible.
[11:16] literal_username: I don't understand the desire to deprecate functionality in order to appease novices.
[11:17] Epeli: Personally I don't care about the Windows support, but I've heard that for PHP proper Windows support was a killer feature which made very popular. I think same could happen for Node too
[11:18] stagas has joined the channel
[11:18] Epeli: literal_username:  the custom fd thing is coming back in another form in 0.8
[11:18] literal_username: Yeah, I don't want Node to immitate PHP. Look at that community. It's all about cheap hacks.

[11:31] PsiliPharm has joined the channel
[11:31] maritz: well, you mentioned money. there's a thing you can do with money that is "spending" and if you spend it by getting developers to work full time on something, you're usually gonna end up with more/better stuff than without it.
[11:31] literal_username: maritz: This is true.
[11:31] disappearedng has joined the channel
[11:32] theCole: marienz: unless you have awesome developers developing for a cause bigger than money
[11:32] theCole: maritz: *
[11:32] literal_username: And I would agree if the money came from anywhere else. But MS always follows their embrace, extend, extinguish pattern.
[11:32] maritz: also, it gets a huge corporation behind node.js. now if someone says: "mimimi, java is so enterprisey, don't use node.js because it's small and no one uses it in the real world, mimimi" you go, "fuck you, tell me what software company that is larger than microsoft is using java but not node.js"
[11:33] literal_username: Again, I agree. Yet the community around MS is less than desirable.
[11:34] gekko_ has joined the channel
[11:34] literal_username: jQuery for example has noticeably lost quality in its community since .NET integration.
[11:34] maritz: theCole: but these awesome devs probably won't suddenly stop because they get money for it?! and if they hate money so much, they can just refuse the money, because guess what: node.js is still open source and will always stay open-source (i think).
[11:34] literal_username: I know, you're right. Again, I have nothing against working for money.
[11:35] literal_username: That's not my issue.
[11:35] literal_username: I understand the economics of the situation, and it makes perfect sense. I still think it's sad.

[11:36] literal_username: I know, I know. If I was a Joyent employee maybe I'd feel different. But as a user, I don't really need the community to grow so much.
[11:36] theCole: theCole: i get paid to code open, it's the best of both worlds
[11:37] theCole: ^_^
[11:37] maritz: you fucker :D
[11:38] filleokus has joined the channel
[11:38] literal_username: I've gotten paid to code open source a few times. It's cool. But I don't think open source is the end-all-be-all. There's a place in this world for proprietary software.
[11:39] literal_username: My problem with Windows has nothing to do with its license, at least not on principle.
[11:39] literal_username: In practice it probably wouldn't suck as much if they accepted contributions, but who am I kidding.
[11:40] theCole: literal_username: no, open is totally the end-all-be-all -- but that will never happen because most people do not get it
[11:41] literal_username: theCole: You don't own a software based business.

[11:44] literal_username: theCole: I mean when you run a business, you have assets that the business is based on. They're what gives your company value. You don't want to give that away to your competitors, because that makes profit impossible.
[11:44] maritz: fivetwentysix: you mean how to write tests with mocha?

[11:45] literal_username: That's probably what MS is doing with Node.js.
[11:45] maritz: literal_username: there are plenty of ways to profit from open source projects. but they're not as clear cut as selling proprietary software and most people refuse to think about it... :x
[11:46] maritz: fivetwentysix: uhm. go with javascript first, then node.js, then mocha.
[11:46] literal_username: maritz: Well, there are a few successful examples, but more examples of proprietary companies using open source compliments.
[11:47] maritz: fivetwentysix: to start learning js: http://www.codecademy.com/languages/javascript

[12:42] subbyyy has joined the channel
[12:43] Cheery: nah. you can better think of it as a version control system based on tracking .splice -method rather than diffing files.
[12:45] Cheery: in my system, whenever there's splice. it's partitioned into pieces {COPY, DELETE, INSERT, COPY}
[12:45] RLa: so it calculates diff in real time?
[12:45] Cheery: it doesn't calculate diff.
[12:45] RLa: at least it sounds like
[12:46] Cheery: it just follows what changes you make.

[17:14] Leemp: Is there a commonly accepted standard for presenting the state of the server to the client? By "state of the server", i mean whether the server is currently development, production, test, etc?
[17:14] WarheadsSE: Leemp: what kind of server ..?
[17:14] Leemp: Web server, sorry :s
[17:14] RLa: Leemp, lot of things tend to use SOMETHING_ENV environment variable
[17:15] RLa: i do not like it tho
[17:15] Leemp: I had assumed that sending a custom header might be a handy way, but apparently JavaScript (in the browser ofcourse), can't read headers of the current document

[17:16] Leemp: RLa: "destroys your production database" wtf? I'm lost :s

[17:18] r1ngzer0 has joined the channel
[17:18] RLa: Leemp, that's ok, but if you expect SERVER_ENV: development and someone sends SERVER_ENV: production then you can be screwed

[17:19] Leemp: RLa: "screwed" i'm so lost xD, If your client JS cvode thinks it's development, and tries to destroy your servers database.. why would your production server let it destroy the database?
[17:19] RLa: config.json won't be in rcs
[17:20] RLa: Leemp, would you protect against it?
[17:20] Leemp: If your Client can "destroy your production database" at all, you have serious problems :P
[17:20] RLa: what if you forget to plug all possible holes (and custom header looks like one)
[17:20] RLa: because it can be set by client
[17:21] RLa: never trust client!
[17:21] Leemp: no, it cant.. can it?
[17:21] Leemp: Dude
[17:21] Leemp: The server sends the header, done.
[17:21] Leemp: No?
[17:21] RLa: then it works
[17:21] RLa: but not if client sends
[17:21] Leemp: (I'm sorry, i'm just getting frustrated. Pardon my shortness)

[17:22] WarheadsSE: why not have it just *ask* the server?

[17:23] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[17:23] Leemp: WarheadsSE: I was simply asking if there was any decent method to have the server tell the client information about itself. Things like development, version, etc. The problem is, ClientJS cannot access headers from the current request
[17:24] Leemp: WarheadsSE: It can only make a 2nd header request.. which would add to your network traffic
[17:24] maxogden: client js is capable of reading http headers

[17:25] RLa: what about current host? put development in development.example.com

[17:26] tlack_: Leemp: ive done this before to indicate which server was used to serve the request in a load balanced environment for instance
[17:26] maxogden: Leemp: two common solutions is to either append <script type='text/javascript> window.config = {"hello":"world"}</script> to your page or fire an xhr on page load that grabs config data

[17:28] benvie: and then sets the __proto__ manually
[17:28] AntelopeSalad: thanks
[17:28] jhooks has joined the channel
[17:29] benvie: er it *doesn;t* use new
[17:29] evilnate has joined the channel
[17:29] benvie: it kind of does
[17:29] benvie: it basically does
[17:29] benvie: x = new Object; x.__proto__ = theProtoParam
[17:29] benvie: so it's doing two steps insteado of one
[17:29] WarheadsSE: the answer on that lnk explains it pretty well :)
[17:29] argami has joined the channel
[17:29] wavded: i don't know if it really 'uses' new, i want to say it doesn't unless your using the shim, i wouldn't shy away from Object.create just because it isn't as fast as new, just give it some time :)
[17:29] WarheadsSE: but ^ pretty much
[17:30] benvie: no it does
[17:30] AntelopeSalad: so it's basically saving you the trouble of having to object.prototye.methodName?
[17:30] benvie: in the source of v8
[17:30] benvie: it literally does what I said
[17:30] trotter has joined the channel
[17:30] benvie: plus some checks
[17:30] benvie: it's implemented in javascript
[17:30] WarheadsSE: really, read the answer to the stackoverflow page..
[17:30] TooTallNate: benvie: that's an implementation detail though; the spec doesn't say "Object.create() must use 'new'"
[17:30] wavded: i wonder if that will change benvie
[17:30] WarheadsSE: *it tells you all about it* mechanics and all
[17:30] benvie: no you're right
[17:30] wavded: right
[17:30] jaha has joined the channel
[17:31] benvie: but if you're using node then this is your implementation =D
[17:31] wavded: true :) for now anyway :)
[17:31] TooTallNate: yup, we're spoiled :)
[17:31] benvie: so I try to know it better than the others

[17:31] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[17:31] benvie: v8 has generally been moving towards MORE self-hosted stuff in js

[17:31] WarheadsSE: I just googlefu & comprehend fast

[17:32] evilnate: asfd

[17:32] evilnate: whoops, sorry
[17:32] wavded: do use for loops for everything or array extras, its going for the better implementation, it will get faster
[17:32] WarheadsSE: AntelopeSalad: because by using new function() you're essentially still paying the price, just splitting that price in 2 places.
[17:32] benvie: Object.create is useful to create an object without invoking constructor functionality
[17:32] benvie: I wouldn't use it on a built in
[17:33] TooTallNate: there's also this ;) https://github.com/TooTallNate/create
[17:33] benvie: but in making another instance of any object that I don't want to go through a constructor I'd use Object.create
[17:33] benvie: or these days I'm tempted to make everything into Proxies
[17:33] benvie: which can actually perform better depending

[17:35] AntelopeSalad: WarheadsSE: where is that price being paid though? i ran 2 tests through jsfiddle and in all cases using new crushes .create
[17:35] tlack_: javascript: super simple until you try to use it
[17:35] WarheadsSE: AntelopeSalad: in the creation of the protoype in the first place.
[17:35] WarheadsSE: aka - at require()

[17:36] yhpark: Hi
[17:36] evilnate has joined the channel
[17:36] yaymukund has joined the channel
[17:36] benvie: so object.create does this
[17:37] benvie: first it checks iuf the proto is null or not a real object
[17:37] yhpark: is there a way to npm install with install options?
[17:37] benvie: so two checks already that new won't do
[17:37] yhpark: like npm install mongodb --mongodb:native
[17:37] benvie: then it does new Object, obj.__proto__ = proto
[17:37] wavded: benvie: do you have a link to the source you are looking at, i'm curious to check it out
[17:37] isaacs: yhpark: yes
[17:37] benvie: then it checks the properties
[17:37] isaacs: yhpark: just like that :)
[17:37] benvie: suyre sed
[17:37] benvie: sec
[17:38] yhpark: I forgot to mention
[17:38] yhpark: shrinkwrap
[17:38] isaacs: yhpark: if the package does anything with it, though, depends on what they're doing.

[17:39] benvie: maybe changing __proto__ is more expensive than I thought
[17:40] willwhite has joined the channel
[17:40] AntelopeSalad: i suppose i'll stick with using new then
[17:41] benvie: if you have like an empty constructor
[17:41] benvie: yeah do that
[17:41] satyr has joined the channel
[17:41] benvie: Object.create to make objects without invoking a constructor specifically, which happens pretty often too
[17:42] AntelopeSalad: i haven't encountered a situation where i would be doing that yet
[17:42] AntelopeSalad: but to be fair i haven't really programmed much heh
[17:42] JasonCrome has joined the channel
[17:42] benvie: well if you're implementing inheritance
[17:42] benvie: if you want to do like
[17:42] benvie: SubType.prototype = Object.create(Type.prototype)
[17:43] dwhittle has joined the channel
[17:43] benvie: you don't want that prototype to actual be initialized by the constructor many times
[17:43] benvie: same thing is accomplished by doing this though
[17:43] fmeyer has joined the channel
[17:43] benvie: SubType.prototype.__proto__ = Type.prototype
[17:44] benvie: using the automatically provided generic object that every functions comes with
[17:44] nateps has joined the channel
[17:44] igl has joined the channel
[17:44] AntelopeSalad: so in that example using .create is actually a better choice for performance?
[17:45] WarheadsSE: >.< the reference library uses friggin readline arg, no wonder mine seems so much more overly complicated.
[17:45] benvie: no changing __proto__ would be better, just wasn't going to be standardized until recently
[17:45] benvie: no the comparison is
[17:45] benvie: Subtype.prototype = new Type
[17:45] benvie: which would in theory also yield a similar result, but it also invokes the constructor logic in Type
[17:45] benvie: which you may not want, usually don't want
[17:46] AntelopeSalad: ah
[17:46] benvie: not for a prototype object
[17:46] wolftankk has joined the channel
[17:46] scowan has joined the channel
[17:46] AntelopeSalad: thanks for the detailed explanations
[17:47] AntelopeSalad: i just find it strange that crockford recommends using .create so much, i've been reading a lot of his material
[17:47] benvie: depends on what Type does, but usually you don't want instance properties hanging around on a prototype, even one inheriting frmo a higher level one
[17:47] benvie: no prob =D
[17:47] AntelopeSalad: i guess it's for more clean code?
[17:47] AntelopeSalad: (to read)
[17:47] AntelopeSalad: he says it's less prone to error (you can't forget to not use new)
[17:47] benvie: I don't recall what his logic was
[17:47] benvie: I don't know what he doesn't like new, or maybe it was just him dealing with all the people who don't
[17:47] horofox: I have [ { title: [Getter/Setter], id: 1 },

[17:48] dodo has joined the channel
[17:48] benvie: the sintleton constructor thing which is what Object.create is modeled on
[17:48] fmeyer has joined the channel
[17:49] AntelopeSalad: hmm
[17:49] benvie: I know the uses for Object.create but I think he used it way more and I don't have any idea why, there's no benefit
[17:50] AntelopeSalad: for a singleton/static set of functionality, couldn't you just throw it into an object?
[17:50] benvie: making good use of both real classish constructors and prototypal inheritance in the right doses is the path to victory in my opinion
[17:50] benvie: well it's for like
[17:50] benvie: you want to inherit from an object
[17:50] benvie: actually this is something I don't see a lot
[17:51] benvie: way more often you see, for example, copying all the properties from one thing to another
[17:51] jaha has joined the channel
[17:51] benvie: when most of those uses would be better served by just doing Object.create(someObject)
[17:51] benvie: like for example, passing in an options object
[17:51] benvie: in jquery
[17:51] benvie: almost all of those uses are pointless
[17:52] benvie: copying all the options over like that onto some new one and comgingin for efaults
[17:52] AntelopeSalad: in that case yeah, .create seems reasonable
[17:52] benvie: you get the same result by using var opts = Object.create(options)
[17:53] benvie: or if it's a throwaway thing for sure
[17:53] wilmoore has joined the channel
[17:53] benvie: if you have your defaults you could do
[17:53] evilnate has joined the channel
[17:53] benvie: options.__proto__ = defaults

[19:13] isaacs: Harzilein: just be in the project when you do that.
[19:14] isaacs: Harzilein: even better: use `npm init` to create a package.json, and then do `npm install <whatever> --save`
[19:14] isaacs: Harzilein: that'll write the dep to your package.json file.  others can then just check out the repo, and `npm install` will pull from that file

[19:24] staar2: well i am havin problems with express error handling, i took the express error handle example but i cant get it working
[19:24] yawNO: Some js devs, notably Isaac Schlueter, have argued more broadly that try/catch is an anti-pattern
[19:24] yawNO: (cit.)
[19:24] staar2: the app.error does not render custom error page
[19:24] isaacs: heh

[19:25] Harzilein: isaacs: but it ends up in my home dir

[19:25] yawNO: it arises a lot of problems
[19:26] yawNO: but anyway here it is http://leanpub.com/asyncjs
[19:26] isaacs: Harzilein: that's because there's no package.json or node_modules folder anywhere, or because you'er already in your home dir and did an install there.

[20:51] thetony: i was on the website looking to do a benchmark on 11g and saw the nosql thing last week - i was just curious if anyone had used it.  i was really surprised to see oracle with a nosql database haha.  btw qbert_ is the first game i remember playing and i busted my head open while playing it
[20:51] qbert_: I think rankings in npm find would solve it :S
[20:51] damiano: example --> /user ---> assigned ot UserController ---> that checks actions

[20:54] damiano: dscape, i used CakePHP and symphony
[20:54] damiano: (php)
[20:55] damiano: maybe i think wrong because i always used php and these frameworks
[20:55] dscape: i understanding your point, but nodejs is different
[20:55] dscape: learn about the core and how it works, this is significantly different from "other stuff"
[20:55] dscape: mvc is just some requires you do, and a decision you make on how to organiza your code

[20:57] dscape: but at what cost?
[20:57] Aiden: dscape: is there a good set of tutorials/documents that help people understand why/how stream and event emitters are so important in node?
[20:58] dscape: this is my personal opinion, lots of other community members have different ones and i respect them

[20:58] dscape: or at least, not enough.
[20:59] Aiden: fair enough. Should someone wanting to understand that just start looking at the core of node?
[20:59] dscape: Aiden: http://blog.dump.ly/post/19819897856/why-node-js-streams-are-awesome
[20:59] dscape: is a nice blog post highlighting why they are cool
[20:59] tlack_: dscape: that would be cool to document, it's a big differentiator from other environments
[20:59] tlack_: Aiden: its just a convenient convention that avoids having to name explicit callbacks, but its common practice in node which makes it handy
[20:59] dscape: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I is a good intro to node for people that come from backgrounds like php
[21:00] Aiden: dscape: thanks for  that link
[21:00] dscape: e.g. in some stuff im working on
[21:00] dscape: i actually pipe a tarball from one server to another to do a streaming deployment
[21:00] dscape: that's 3 lines of code
[21:01] dscape: but yeah, a blog post even on whats a stream, whats a event emitter, whats the difference, when not to use a callback
[21:01] tlack_: dscape: is that dumply post yours? it triggered some really interesting conversation on hn

[21:18] trotter_ has joined the channel

[21:20] damiano: dscape, yes, but it seems a small project, no?
[21:20] damiano: i mean....onyl two controllers
[21:20] dscape: damiano: i removed all the real stuff
[21:20] tlack_: damiano: like var controllers = [ 'user': require('user') ]; for (var idx in controllers) { var c = controllers[idx]; app.all('/'+idx + '/:action?', c.handle); }
[21:20] dscape: its closed source
[21:20] dscape: :)
[21:20] dscape: plus i like making the routes teh center of my app
[21:20] dscape: it allows other developers to be fast finding out where the code is
[21:21] damiano: tlack, c.handle ?
[21:21] tlack_: damiano: c.handle would be somehting you define as exports.handle = function(req, res) { } in each of the controllers 
[21:21] WarheadsSE: damiano: forgive my jump, but after having read the last ~100 lines, I'd say you're too fixated on the methodology vs the solution
[21:21] tlack_: damiano: psuedocode here but you get the idea; maybe simpler than your function-returning-a-function thing
[21:22] damiano: tlack, "handle" should be the :action

[21:23] tlack_: just req.params.action not c. 
[21:23] damiano: c is the controller i have to call the method inside it
[21:23] damiano: but ok
[21:24] tlack_: oh, then you mean c[req.params.action] - c.req.params.action wouldn't make sense
[21:24] damiano: yes yes i wrote worng
[21:24] damiano: excuse me
[21:24] tlack_: remember that in js to look up an arbitrary element of an object you need [] not .

[21:26] tlack_: var a = req.params.action; if (a in c) c[a] else c.index

[21:28] Peter14: Hey guys is it still suggested when rollin out an express app to use a server like nginx to serve static content?
[21:28] tlack_: im trying to think of a way to allow my jr developers to play with node on our dev server, without having to get them to login and run the node app instances themselves. something simpler than git. it would then be plugged into our nginx config automatically. anything out there?
[21:29] rjack: I'm trying put together an npm package of a small node.js script that needs to fs.readFileSync an Handlebar template. How do I define this template file in package.json? How do I reference it in my code?

[21:29] maxogden: tlack_: check out propagit by substack

[21:31] WarheadsSE: Peter14: because servince static content, espeically any "larger" files, it best handled by something specialized in it.
[21:31] WarheadsSE: plus, then your node app isnt spinning on sending this file to a client
[21:32] tlack_: Peter14: another option would be to aggressively use S3 :)
[21:33] qbert_: thats the approach I take
[21:33] Peter14: Got ya. Yeah I like the price tag of nginx compared to s3 though. Not enough users to justify the cost of the service. Thanks guys for the input

[23:02] ted_ has joined the channel
[23:02] tlack_: tbranyen: my mind is blown because the idea that you could just write very high levelJS and have it suddenly become an app hosted in the cloud -- without even having to work on the admin system/backend -- is pretty next level
[23:02] tbranyen: tlack_: ya i signed up i wanna see what its about
[23:02] tbranyen: but i have my reservations
[23:02] tlack_: onto: what do you mean by that? have you read the express.js guide at expressjs.com?
[23:03] tlack_: tbranyen: "fork" (steal) his idea but for knockout or agility.js plz

[23:04] onto: tlack_: In symfony/yii (I come from PHP) -- When I define a route, I can later reference them to build URLs. Similar to the rails url_for helper, is there such a helper in express.js (it does not state any in the guide)?
[23:05] tlack_: onto: im still new to express and node but i havent seen anything. that would be a cool piece of middleware to write and release though
[23:05] tlack_: actually, im not sure how it would work - how would you refer to the other endpoint?
[23:06] tlack_: the routes are defined explicitly and the callback is linked in that explicit piece of code; what would you refer to?
[23:06] onto: tlack_: I was thinking of named references
[23:06] tlack_: onto: psuedocode me
[23:06] onto: tlack_: For example: app.get('/user/:id', function(){}, 'user.profile')
[23:07] onto: and to refer back to it: app.url('user.profile', {id:3})
[23:07] onto: ... or somewhere along those lines

[23:15] argami has joined the channel
[23:15] tlack_: onto: i kinda like this dude's structure https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/express-boilerplate
[23:15] SubStack: onto: it's still mad science at this point but you could use dnode to start with http://github.com/substack/dnode
[23:16] zackattack_ has joined the channel
[23:16] tlack_: onto: there are a million ways to do it. see the express examples for more https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples
[23:16] SubStack: for instance my startup has a completly separate auth, webapp, nexus, logger, tunnel, stripe, and encoder servers that all talk to each other on the network over dnode
[23:16] benvie: substack check this https://gist.github.com/1db0cd254126f8c0e53b
[23:16] SubStack: actually they use upnode which is an abstraction on top of dnode to keep the connections alive no matter what
[23:17] cjm has joined the channel
[23:17] SubStack: and actually now I'm porting them to airport which is an abstraction on top of upnode to integrate with seaport, a service registry
[23:17] tlack_: as an alternative you could also use require() lol
[23:17] tlack_: i kid i kid
[23:17] SubStack: benvie: what is this?
[23:18] benvie: it automatically turns js objects into a struct using best fit binary types
[23:18] benvie: and can then instantiate on a buffer from the struct
[23:18] CloudGroup has joined the channel
[23:18] SubStack: neat
[23:18] onto: SubStack: thank you for the resources! tlack_: I'll see if I can whip up a middleware
[23:18] benvie: I was thinking about it cause of
[23:18] benvie: dnode
[23:19] tlack_: benvie: does it do functions? 
[23:19] cipher__: http://pastie.org/private/sfpthpb8ad88a2lrcoihdq  ... is there any reason why this would not print the string returned by readFile?
[23:19] benvie: no just a hack I made on top of binary data tool
[23:19] benvie: it's closer to like binary json I guess
[23:19] benvie: but I made a proxy lib that wraps the structs
[23:19] benvie: and exposes them like normal js objects
[23:19] benvie: so you could be working entirely on a buffer too
[23:20] benvie: your entire js context directly mapping to a buffer
[23:20] Mcilvena has joined the channel
[23:20] Aiden has joined the channel
[23:21] jocafa: we use protocol buffers here
[23:21] benvie: and even completely in secret too if you wanted
[23:21] benvie: cause you can wrap the objects too look like normal oens
[23:21] SubStack: benvie: you could use https://github.com/substack/node-archy to pretty print that output
[23:21] onto: Correct me if I'm wrong but express (is a router?) is built on top of connect (http server framework?) so I need to write a middleware for connect?
[23:21] SubStack: what with the nested elements
[23:21] SubStack: npm-style
[23:21] torvalamo: you know in movies when the main character sort of goes into a trance and hears everything louder and louder and repeated until it becomes almost unbearable and then he snaps out of it and yells "I HATE <insert whatever he's mad about>!!!" ? That's how I feel when people talk about libraries. Fuck libraries. Just make something that actually has value. The end.
[23:21] benvie: yeah I need to revisit the formatting with this kind of struct hah
[23:22] benvie: actually it looks really cool in the repl
[23:22] benvie: I have it set up to use colors in the repl to signify types
[23:22] SubStack: onto: you don't need to write middlewares necessarily
[23:22] SubStack: you can just use programming
[23:22] jocafa: ACTION writes a library for writing libraries for torvalamo
[23:22] jocafa: ¬¬
[23:22] iaingrant: torvalamo: libraries have value, or at least did have
[23:22] bEEEviz has joined the channel
[23:22] benvie: yeah I've been sort of thinking a different angle recently
[23:23] iaingrant: oh, maybe the wrong kind of library I'm thinking
[23:23] onto: SubStack: ?
[23:23] benvie: which is instead of say learning how to integrate a library
[23:23] timoxley: torvalamo are modules = libraries ?
[23:23] benvie: figure out how to make a library transparently integrate with stuff already in place
[23:23] iaingrant: I'm thinking the physical type.... heh
[23:23] iaingrant: borrow books etc
[23:23] iaingrant: oh crap
[23:23] qbert_: cipher__, yeah, youre using an asynch function, and not waiting for it to return, use readFileSync
[23:24] torvalamo: some people write libraries because they don't actually have an idea, they just wanna makes something with something... stop doing that... go take a walk instead and come back with an idea.

[23:25] thetony: torvalamo: you have any ideas for my joint workflow project? ;)
[23:25] thetony: http://datazoo.info/workflow/#
[23:25] torvalamo: what is it
[23:25] SubStack: torvalamo: hey I do that
[23:25] thetony: i'm making a visio like browser app that will let people create and modify workflows with one another
[23:25] SubStack: actually I write libraries because I am bad at writing applications
[23:25] SubStack: libraries are much easier
[23:25] qbert_: SubStack++
[23:25] benvie: yeah same
[23:26] torvalamo: thetony, so it's like a shared blackboard thing
[23:26] SubStack: and you can just plug them into your application and it'll be like 3 lines
[23:26] qbert_: thetony, that looks dangerously like the app im building
[23:26] benvie: a library is like putting together the legos in the right order
[23:26] benvie: it's fun
[23:26] thetony: torvalamo: yea, i plan on having workspaces for folks.  i need it to model customer's data warehouses is how i started out but it's turned a lot more demand than i thought
[23:26] thetony: qbert_: what are you writing?  we can co-op
[23:27] torvalamo: a library is like making the drawing for the lego things. why don't you just make the lego thing instead.
[23:27] qbert_: thetony,  a form designer + workflow app, fill out a new hire form, it goes through approval,  SVN access gets created, ldap setup, payroll emailed, shit like that, except all automated
[23:28] thetony: qbert_: ahh i was going to make mine pluggable into other apps as well - mostly the data warehouse i'm writing in node
[23:28] torvalamo: question #1: am I solving a problem? wrong answer: no I'm just bored. right answer: yes, this app solves x problem. this library is a subsection of x problem.
[23:28] qbert_: yeah shoot me an email, IM ing you
[23:29] qbert_: if anyones bored, feel free to write some jagpdf bindings for node :P

[23:39] disappea_: Hey is it possible to clear timeout but preserver the function? I want to set a different time out for a specific timeout handler
[23:40] qbert_: disappea_, clearInterval() ?
[23:40] qbert_: oh preserve the function
[23:41] disappea_: so I have setTimeout(foo, 30000); now I want to setTimeout(foo, 5000);
[23:41] ljharb: disappea_: if you can keep a reference to the timeout, you can keep one to the function
[23:41] rlidwka_: just save foo to a different variable :)

[23:42] disappea_: ah that's a doable "hack"

[23:44] onto has left the channel
[23:44] spion has joined the channel
[23:44] ljharb: thetony: the one set in the timeout can't be changed, so therefore, the function referenced by "foo" wouldn't change
[23:44] rlidwka: how you can change it?
[23:44] JmZ_ has joined the channel
[23:45] thetony: ljharb: it can, setTimeout("foo()",500) isn't the same as setTimeout(foo,500) ?
[23:45] ljharb: thetony: your first example sets it to the return value of foo. so do var bar = foo(); setTimeout(bar, 500); etc
[23:45] thetony: it can also change if something on the form is changing
[23:45] ljharb: any time you rely on the result returned from a function, you should be caching that result
[23:45] perezd has joined the channel
[23:46] ljharb: and in that case, the function should remain the same, but should be able to handle the dynamic circumstances.
[23:46] thetony: yes but the point is that it can change - i guess in your app you would know that already and can account for it
