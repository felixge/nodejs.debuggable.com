[00:50] sctb: Hi folks, is it possible to do a blocking read on stdin? Basically I have a function that can't return until some condition has been satisfied which involves reading from a stream (stdin).
[00:51] TheJH: sctb, I am aware of the risk of stating the obvious, but I'm pretty sure you're doing it wrong
[00:51] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[00:52] sctb: TheJH: in this particular case, I absolutely cannot return from this function until I've read some input.
[00:52] TheJH: sctb, why? do you know the concept of a callback?
[00:53] TheJH: sctb, you *could* probably write a C++ extension for this, but don't do it or god will kill a kitten
[00:53] saikat has joined the channel
[00:54] TheJH: sctb, mind describing your paricular case?
[00:54] sctb: TheJH: Yes, I know the concept of a callback. I'm interacting with the v8 debugger, which calls my function when a break event occurs. Once my function returns, the debugger resumes execution of the program. However, I need to allow the user to intervene with debugging commands before doing so.

[01:12] MatthewS: what is your timeout set to in nginx?
[01:12] kenperkins: MatthewS: 15s
[01:12] DualDetroit: kenperkins: I suspect node.js has a bug somewhere where the socket reference is mangled. I solved my timeouts issue by explicitly passing the request around as an argument to each function, rather than relying on it to still be in scope for the closure.
[01:13] kenperkins: and nginx and node are on the same machine, cpu is flatline at 2% the whole time
[01:13] DualDetroit: kenperkins: How many requests/minute max?
[01:13] kenperkins: I'd have to go look at some aggregated numbers
[01:13] kenperkins: but not a lot, we just launched, still pretty modest traffic

[01:51] markdaws: DualDetroit: thanks for the tips, we have a lot of code as well, hard to pin down the seemingly long delays, doesn't seem to be any pattern to which calls fail, all over the code, or any kind of period.  No other errors in our logs from services node calls into, guess we have to try to instrument everything to track it down.
[01:51] DualDetroit: response.write() would fail about 1/3rd of the time under high load
[01:51] aeo: request.post({uri:'example.php', body:'act=something&token=somethingelse'});
[01:51] aeo: But in example.php $_REQUEST['act'] is blank
[01:51] aeo: So apparently I'm messing something up
[01:52] DualDetroit: markdaws: Hmm. Is it timing out, or just long response times?
[01:53] DualDetroit: Disclaimer: I am not a Node expert and we've been forced to switch to Twisted on new projects.
[01:53] markdaws: we have a 15 second upstream read timeout from nginx to node, so node is taking longer than 15 seconds to respond, but seemingly randonly, like on call that don't do anything fancy, sometimes just on calls to render pages via express

[03:02] wong has joined the channel
[03:02] Aikar: seems rather trivial to run it under a chroot, monitor file changes or simply run under a new chroot lol
[03:03] Aikar: (not advocating privacy, just curious as to how people actually try it on an OS designed to let you fully know wtf an app is doing)

[03:11] russfrank: Aikar: only root can chroot though so that sounds pretty impractical
[03:11] russfrank: oh wait
[03:11] russfrank: you're saying how to get around a trial?
[03:12] russfrank: well yeah, obviously there are ways to get around trials, haha
[03:12] Aikar: yeah, saying its so easy to reset the counter on linux
[03:12] russfrank: it's also easy to do it on windows
[03:12] aroman: or Mac or any other platform.
[03:12] russfrank: considering most apps just pull the time and check it against some value

[03:53] rayfinkle_ has joined the channel
[03:55] tmpvar: so I need to pass a struct between two addons.  I was thinking ObjectWrap, but that would require the addons to share a class def (too much coupling for me).  Do you think packing it into a buffer and passing that around is a decent option?
[03:56] tmpvar: the usecase here is passing a custom cairo_surface_t into a lightly patched node-canvas
[03:57] tbranyen: hmmm so you'd serialize it to something that can be packed into a buffer, pass that, and then deserialize it?
[03:58] tbranyen: and just maintain the same struct on both endpoints
[03:59] rickharrison has joined the channel
[03:59] tmpvar: yeah, the idea would be to cast it to the struct
[03:59] tmpvar: (as it is a dependency to both addons)

[05:48] firebus: if node dies do to an uncaught exception, it seems like process.on('exit') doesn't get called. is that how it's supposed to work?
[05:48] yenz: kenperkins: think so... from when we last chatted
[05:48] perezd: yenz: you can process.exit (and should)

[05:49] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[05:49] perezd: if you explicitly call it within uncaught exception, does it fire the event you want?

[05:49] kenperkins: any thoughts yenz? (feedback, etc)

[05:50] yenz: but you need to mouseover a section of the page to actually have something happen

[08:31] mtyaka: Hello folks! I'm a node noob running into a strange problem... I have a node program that calls fs.stat on about 50,000 files one by one  - it starts by calling fs.stat on one file. When the fs.stat callback is invoked, it calls fs.stat on the next file.... and so on until all of the 50,000 files have been stated.
[08:32] mtyaka: The problem that I am seeing is that sometimes one of the fs.stat callbacks never gets invoked, which halts my callback chain.
[08:32] sfoster: do you really need to result of one stat before you do the next? 
[08:33] sfoster: surely the point of async file i/o is to do that kind of stuff in parallel?
[08:33] mtyaka: no, i don't really need it
[08:33] mtyaka: i am simplifying a bit here
[08:33] sfoster: not that that addresses your issues...
[08:33] sfoster: well it might, but only by coincidence
[08:34] Morkel has joined the channel
[08:34] mtyaka: yes, the thing is, i need to know when all of the files have been stated
[08:34] mtyaka: it doesn't matter whether the calls run in parallel or serially
[08:34] sfoster: right. there's various libs for managing queues of async calls last I looked. 
[08:35] sfoster: it would speed up your program a lot I'd expect. 
[08:35] mtyaka: because if one of them halts, i'll get stuck again

[08:39] elliottcable: mtyaka: can you isolate which one?
[08:39] elliottcable: or rather, the previous one.
[08:39] mtyaka: i need to read the contents of a folder, and then run fs.stat on each of the files

[10:56] ablomen has joined the channel
[10:56] sineltor: ppcano: well, its javascript. Can you just mock out http or something?
[10:56] SubStack: ppcano: what is the problem?

[10:57] npa has joined the channel
[10:57] SubStack: don't even mention mocking for a moment
[10:57] SubStack: what specifically are you trying to do
[10:57] martin_sunset:   ppcano nmock works very well for me
[10:58] SubStack: don't feed the xy problem!
[10:58] ppcano: SubStack: a instance must respond with the data provides from an external service 
[10:59] SubStack: ppcano: I'm still not sure what you're actually trying to do
[10:59] SubStack: be more specific
[11:00] SubStack: namely, what sort of instance? how does the external service respond with data? how is that normally done?
[11:01] SubStack: are you writing unit tests or doing something else entirely?
[11:01] ppcano: Substack: After some events in my app logic, an event handler must send an event to different socket.io clients with data which comes from an external service (JSON service). I am doing some integration tests, and wantj to test this behaviour. 
[11:01] sineltor: so you want to mock out the JSON service
[11:01] sineltor: is that JSON over REST or JSON over socket.io?
[11:02] SubStack: you can pretty easily hack up a server that will serve up json with just http.createServer()
[11:02] SubStack: just don't hard-code the server name so you can pass that in as an argument
[11:04] hipsterslapfight: does anybody have a recommendation for a - possibly RESTful - json client library?
[11:05] ppcano: sineltor: i don't stll know, that's why i want some feedback. The service respond JSON data, and this data must be sent to clients connected with socket.io
[11:05] emattias_ has joined the channel
[11:05] SubStack: hipsterslapfight: you can just use http.get and JSON.parse
[11:05] sineltor: ppcano: ok, well thats a different question :)

[17:32] danjx: you guys need to add your own debugging code to your routes
[17:32] danjx: before, res.send(''+(new Date()).getTime());, do a console.log('..')
[17:33] danjx: console.log() is pretty basic, better to use a logging mechanism so you can do stuff like log.error() log.info() and selectively turn that information on or off

[17:36] kenperkins: I instrumented one route to debug spew at the start of the route handler, before each step with work, and after res.render()
[17:36] kenperkins: and we saw all of the debug spew and the timeout still happened
[17:36] kenperkins: that at least leads me to believe it was somewhere in res.send or res.render
[17:36] MatthewS: really? now that's getting interesting
[17:36] kenperkins: I presume that res.render is calling res.send under the covers
[17:36] kenperkins: Let me find log exerpt for you MatthewS 
[17:37] bobthebuilder: hello. I'm "designing" node.js cluster at the moment, but I'm not sure what's the most user friendly RPC module for inter-node communication that's available right now. any suggestions?
[17:37] bobthebuilder: a node.js cluster*
[17:37] kenperkins: http://www.clipboard.com/clip/LQzkP6v7D0J_6IeHHtnthFe0-O1xtZGsJiPe
[17:38] kenperkins: MatthewS: look at line 9 (Sent Landing) from web-01 at 23:20:36
[17:38] kenperkins: the corresponding timeout is the very last line
[17:38] kenperkins: exactly 15 seconds later on the same server

[17:44] MatthewS: ken: hmm, not sure how to proceed next.  my usual toolkit would be strace'ing the process in question.  debugger on the process another option?  do you have system level metrics to make sure nothing is going on there?

[18:08] EyePulp: dexter_e: keeps your repo clean.  you should make a package.json which specifies versions for the modules you want.

[20:56] JmZ: and in some modules, I can't pass it because the module's exported function is used as a callback

[21:00] isaacs: ashb: you go into the folder, and run `npm publish`
[21:00] isaacs: ashb: you may need to update the version number.
[21:00] isaacs: but that should be it
[21:00] isaacs: ashb: it helps to use a recent version of npm

[21:01] isaacs: (there was a jump from 30->90 when windows support was added)
[21:01] ashb: don't update npm very often - how do i updateit?
[21:02] isaacs: ircretary: inst ashb
[21:02] JmZ: jerrysv: I can't, it's a callback, already thought of that
[21:02] isaacs: er, my bot does not like being repetitive.
[21:02] ashb: ah same. k
[21:02] isaacs: member:ashb: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[21:02] JmZ: jerrysv: meaning it has specific arguments, and i'm not running a method beforehand because that means initialising it even if it's not going to be used
[21:02] jerrysv: jmz: import it as part of a module
[21:02] isaacs: yeah, just install again
[21:03] jerrysv: and use a singleton pattern
[21:03] JmZ: jerrysv: its already a module what do you mean?
[21:03] isaacs: ashb: for small-ish updates, you can usually do `npm -g inst npm`
[21:03] JmZ: oh i see what you're saying
[21:03] JmZ: whatever ill go fiddle around for a while again

[21:04] JmZ: callbacks are very inconvenient sometimes. e.g. with the mongodb module, db.open(function(error, client) {}); what if i want to use the db in various places?
[21:05] JmZ: im expected to cram all my code in one big db.open callback?
[21:05] ashb: konobi: add me a -I flag will you - i miss it >_>
[21:05] JmZ: i'd much rather have an instance of a class i can execute queries through
[21:05] JmZ: than a one-off callback

[21:05] ashb: konobi: what was the reason against?
[21:05] jerrysv: jmz: it's a bit cleaner than mongodb-native
[21:06] ashb: konobi: cos well everything else has one. like *everything*
[21:06] isaacs: konobi, ashb: what's -l?
[21:06] konobi: -I in perl is lib include path

[21:06] konobi: ashb: true

[21:07] ashb: isaacs: setting NODE_PATH to anything seems to remove all the standard dirs
[21:07] isaacs: doesn't seem like there's anything to worry about stomping...
[21:07] jerrysv: jmz: understood. there have been a lot of problems solved, just need to find the right solution out of the thousand
[21:07] isaacs: ashb: what "standard dirs"?
[21:07] konobi: node_modules?
[21:08] isaacs: node_modules still work
[21:08] jstash: where's a good place to post a node.js job posting?
[21:08] isaacs: node_modules are *higher* priority, i believe.

[21:08] konobi: jstash: =0P
[21:08] jstash: huzzah!
[21:08] ashb: can't remember - this is all off hazy memories. and i was trying to run the equive of node -I../lib
[21:08] ashb: with some global npm dirs and couldn't seem to get both working
[21:08] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:08] isaacs: the thing is, yes, perl and ruby and python have something like this.
[21:08] isaacs: and they're worse for it.
[21:08] isaacs: php has this as well.  it's terrible.
[21:09] konobi: i like the perl behaviour
[21:09] ashb: isaacs: and gcc, and lua
[21:09] isaacs: node's way is better.  innovation is necessarily different.
[21:09] konobi: use lib qw(../../lib);
[21:09] isaacs: not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is necessarily a change.  opposing change as-such is not wise.
[21:09] ashb: bah looks like i might have lost my npm author credentials somewhere...

[21:10] ashb: konobi: its evil and you know it
[21:11] konobi: yup... but insanely useful at times (like mocked classes, etc)
[21:11] caolanm has joined the channel
[21:11] ashb: should npm publish give me any kind of feedback...?
[21:11] isaacs: ashb: not unless you have the loglevel turned up higher than "warn"
[21:11] isaacs: 1.0 is pretty quiet
[21:11] ashb: thats slightly disconcerting fwiw
[21:11] isaacs: if you reminisce for the older log style, you can `npm config set loglevel info`
[21:12] jerrysv: isaacs: what about npm publish -v ?
[21:12] isaacs: jerrysv: -v is already taken for "output the version".  it's -d
[21:12] isaacs: or -dd or -ddd
[21:12] jerrysv: isaacs: or --verbose ?
[21:12] isaacs: jerrysv: that works, too

[21:15] jesusabdullah: konobi: setInterval(function, 0) ?
[21:15] jstash: function fn(){ doStuff(); nextTick(fn()) } ?
[21:15] JmZ: why does node's JS parsing (e.g. package.json) require double-quotes?
[21:15] JmZ: {'abc':5} is valid JSON...
[21:15] jstash: er, no () after 2nd fn
[21:15] konobi: jstash: lemme ping you about it
[21:15] jesusabdullah: JmZ: No it's not
[21:15] isaacs: ashb: you're setting repositories, should just be one, as "repository"
[21:15] jesusabdullah: JmZ: { 'foo': 5 } is valid javascript but not valid json. json is more strict.
[21:15] ashb: ah another change
[21:16] ezmobius has joined the channel
[21:16] mikeal has joined the channel
[21:16] ashb: isaacs: that package.json was *very* old
[21:16] isaacs: ashb: there've been some refinements to the old commonjs package.json spec.
[21:16] ashb: anything else look amis?
[21:16] JmZ: jesusabdullah: why doesn't it allow single quotes?
[21:16] isaacs: ashb: i think when we realized that there were some 2000 packages that defined a repository, and *none* that specified multiple repositories, the whole "it's an array" thing looked pretty silly.
[21:16] JmZ: jesusabdullah: i mean JSON in general
[21:17] konobi: jesusabdullah: that's sorta what it's doing now, but the function is one returned from bind
[21:17] isaacs: ashb: "bugs" should be "url", not "name"
[21:17] jesusabdullah: JmZ: Ask Doug Crockford, basically, is the answer.
[21:17] isaacs: ashb: other than that, looks fine.   and i think even that will default properly anyhow

[21:18] isaacs: ashb: i mean, yeah, blah blah blah, forced updates and unpublish etc.
[21:18] ashb: :)
[21:19] isaacs: ashb: agreed.
[21:19] isaacs: ashb: there are so very many things to do.

[21:51] jerrysv: jmz: odd, we're using it in production here -- do you have an example?
[21:51] JmZ: jerrysv: e.g. if you insert {"a":5, "b":6}, it doesn't add _id to that
[21:51] JmZ: but with standard mongodb native, it does
[21:52] jerrysv: interesting -- i'm not seeing that behavior
