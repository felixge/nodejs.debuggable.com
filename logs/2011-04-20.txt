[00:00] techwraith: querrying works pretty much the same as mongo-native
[00:00] NuckingFuts: techwraith: I'm happy with mongo-native nowadays.  Biggest thing that scared me off was the callbacks, but now that I can understand scope in JS, it's not so scary :P
[00:00] NuckingFuts: I mean, 10 levels nested is nothing to me
[00:00] NuckingFuts: But at the time, it made me shit myself
[00:00] jjmalina: NuckingFuts: I hated mongoose too but now i actually like it
[00:00] techwraith: Yeah, mongo-native works well, mongoose just simplifies it a bit
[00:01] techwraith: And adds in a bunch of cool features (Schemas, Validation, etc.)

[00:02] techwraith: It's nice to be able to have real Models with Mongo
[00:02] NuckingFuts: I manage my own local caches, I don't need validation, and schemas are worthless to me, since I got so used to dealing with MySQL
[00:02] NuckingFuts: So I basically have a mental model of my data types
[00:03] techwraith: To each his own :)

[00:45] a|i: SubStack: in dnode, how is it possible to use EventEmitter to send messages to a group of client, and not all of them?
[00:47] ManishMaheshwari has joined the channel
[00:48] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[00:48] SubStack: a|i: just send out different EventEmitters
[00:48] SubStack: different and multiple
[00:49] SubStack: group, global, individual perhaps
[00:49] a|i: SubStack: so to have different chat rooms, for each chat room, we need a dedicated EventEmitter instance?
[00:49] SubStack: or else you could modify the emit loop to check for metadata about where to send the events
[00:50] SubStack: a|i: that could work
[00:50] a|i: SubStack: and this is efficient, right?
[00:50] a|i: (no idea what's going on inside EventEmitter, just using it as a blackbox)
[00:50] SubStack: efficiency is something you measure
[00:50] SubStack: build it first, optimize later
[00:51] SubStack: a|i: have you also read http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e ?
[00:51] jesusabdullah: I should build pubsub capabilities into ircrpc :)
[00:51] a|i: SubStack: sure, not try to do the 'premature optimisation' here, just making sure sure it's not an obvious case of inefficiency
[00:53] qbert_ has joined the channel
[00:53] SubStack: well if you were making a new EventEmitter for every possible combination of users that would be worrisome but having at most a few dozen EventEmitters seems perfectly fine
[00:53] slickplaid: mutt
[00:53] slickplaid: doh
[00:54] a|i: SubStack: so if the number of chat rooms is a lot, the approach in that link you sent works better than having an array of EventEmitters?
[00:55] SubStack: that article shows the approach for one event emitter
[00:55] matschaffer has joined the channel
[00:55] SubStack: I don't think it matters either way
[00:55] a|i: SubStack: why is that Hash is used then?
[00:55] dcampano: anybody know why http.request makes a dns request everytime instead of caching the results
[00:56] eb4890 has joined the channel
[00:56] SubStack: a|i: it's just shorthand to loop over the values in an object
[00:56] jga023 has joined the channel
[00:57] a|i: SubStack: i meant why not just using EventEmitter#emit(), like the chat example in github?
[00:57] ManishMaheshwari has joined the channel
[00:58] SubStack: a|i: the approach in the article is a better general approach because it avoids the potential for missed messages at startup
[00:58] SubStack: because the server could start emitting messages before the client has bound its listeners
[00:59] a|i: SubStack: good point.
[01:00] a|i: SubStack: why is that reconnect doesn't work in dnode? it has been implemente din socketio?
[01:00] a|i: SubStack: if the node server is restarted, the clients do not reconnect.
[01:00] SubStack: because it's tricky to do well
[01:02] ManishMaheshwari has joined the channel
[01:02] dansays has joined the channel
[01:03] a|i: SubStack: but socketio already handles it, I don't understand why it shouldn't work in dnonde out of the box?

[01:23] AAA_awright: a|i: Standard practice is just create multiple event emitters, one for "message" and "message#channel" etc. If you need to get more specific than that, it's the hook's job to filter based on the event data it gets
[01:24] AAA_awright: i.e. if(event.messageFrom=="someUser") return;

[03:07] Aikar: how do you do the equiv of blah.apply(scope, arguments) but with the new keyword?
[03:08] gtramont1na: yo Aikar... Remember you gave me a hand on running Vows from inside your script? You pointed me to a project of yours in github.
[03:09] Aikar: yes, all of mine have that stub lol
[03:09] Aikar: http://github.com/aikar/wormhole/
[03:09] Aikar: click on runTest.js
[03:10] gtramont1na: so yes... But I couldn't make it work over here :-/
[03:10] Aikar: i dunno how expresso does its bin path, but in the vows package it has a bin folder, with a file in it named vows
[03:10] techwraith has joined the channel
[03:10] gtramont1na: Does it print something in the console when you run it?
[03:10] Aikar: find similiar for expresso
[03:11] Aikar: then do that too ie require('expresso/binfolder/executablefilename')
[03:11] Aikar: if you have vows installed (globally or locally in node_modules) my stub will work

[03:19] bingomanatee: 1, 2, 3....
[03:19] Aikar: gtramont1na: its vows/bin/vows
[03:19] Aikar: BIN not LIB
[03:19] NuckingFuts: ... does the callback get a cursor or the count?

[03:22] bingomanatee: NuckingFuts - the cursor class has a count method
[03:23] bingomanatee: so you should be able to call count() off any find's returned cursor.

[03:33] Aikar: gtramont1na: odd O.o
[03:33] gtramont1na: indeed
[03:34] Aikar: gtramont1na: check package.json see where it defines the bin path

[04:47] Evanlec: Hi, so I understand now what closures are, but when are they useful? or what's a common usage for them? Appreciate any explation!
[04:47] Evanlec: *explanation
[04:48] binaryjohn has joined the channel
[04:49] Draggor: Evanlec: if you're feeling fun, you can make an object system using them.
[04:50] Evanlec: oof, that doesn't sound like much fun...
[04:50] Draggor: var counter = (function() { var cnt = 0; return function() { return cnt++; }; })();
[04:50] Evanlec: I mean, I guess I'd rather create an object system with objects
[04:50] Draggor: every time you call counter you get a new incrementing number and you can't thwack the variable.
[04:51] Evanlec: Draggor: ah i see, and the benefit there is we don't need to use a global var to keep track of the number?
[04:51] Evanlec: one thing that i keep wanting to do is access properties from closures but I cant!
[04:52] Draggor: Evanlec: I use them in a throttle function.  Say you want to queue up invocations of a function after you've hit a burst limit, say irc.
[04:52] Evanlec: I guess its hard to adjust to the new way of thinking
[04:52] Draggor: Evanlec: https://github.com/draggor/node-ircbot/blob/master/util.js#L125
[04:53] gazumps has joined the channel
[04:53] Evanlec: Draggor: what exactly would that do? in real application?
[04:54] Evanlec: oh, a burst limit...okay
[04:54] Draggor: Evanlec: that's for throttling on irc.  Freenode allows five messages in a one second window, then one message per two seconds afterwards
[04:54] Evanlec: a way to deal with load spike?
[04:54] Evanlec: oh okay
[04:54] Evanlec: gotcha
[04:54] Draggor: So I wrap my bot.say function in burstThrottle
[04:54] Draggor: on line 139 you can see where I apply a context
[04:55] Draggor: That's technically not the best way to do that
[04:56] Evanlec: the func.apply(ctx,args) adds extra arguments if you so desire?
[04:56] Evanlec: oh, line 139 
[04:56] Draggor: it provides the this to the function I'm passing in
[04:57] Draggor: so if ctx = {a:1}, and the function I throttle is function(){console.log(this.a);}  it'll know what I want.
[04:57] AbeEstrada has joined the channel
[04:57] Evanlec: not familiar with the apply method, its a standard method for all function objects?
[04:57] Draggor: Evanlec: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/function/apply and https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[04:57] tonymilne: apply is called on a function itself, and as the first param you pass the context, then an array of arguments. (from memory)

[05:00] Evanlec: np
[05:01] Evanlec: Draggor: could you not just pass the ctx as a param to that function?
[05:01] Draggor: Yes
[05:01] Draggor: Evanlec: I actually have an updated version that makes a var self = this;
[05:01] Evanlec: whats tthe purpose of doing it your way
[05:01] Draggor: and passes it in automatically
[05:01] Draggor: Fail on my part really
[05:01] Evanlec: Oh ;p

[05:02] cognominal has joined the channel
[05:02] Evanlec: god this stuff is making my head hurt
[05:02] Draggor: basically I want a method on an object to act as my say() function, but I have a reference tothe literal irc client in there, so I want to pass it as the context.
[05:03] Evanlec: Draggor: oh, so wait now, you're using this a lot, is this sort of like a way to give a function object-like properties?
[05:03] ajak1: theres a better way than var self = this?
[05:03] Draggor: ajak1: No, I'm passing in the context by hand instead of using self = this
[05:04] Draggor: and using apply appropriately >_>
[05:04] Draggor: I really need to fix that
[05:04] Evanlec: Draggor: using closures, does 'this' give us an object-like system?
[05:05] Draggor: hrrm, what's got the best tutorial on 'this'

[05:06] Evanlec: Draggor: why are you using this.<var> inside bot() instead of just var ?
[05:06] Evanlec: Draggor: ah ok
[05:07] Draggor: Bot() is an object constructor function
[05:07] Draggor: so I do var myBot = new Bot();
[05:07] Draggor: and all the this.var sets the properties on the new object I get
[05:07] Evanlec: ooh ok

[05:17] disq has joined the channel
[05:17] mnutt: is there a better way?
[05:18] Draggor: mnutt: keep all of your connections in an object that's an export in a module, require that across your others?
[05:18] Draggor: as node caches modules it won't get reloaded, just reference

[06:29] jesusabdullah: Oh, and making functions is expensive since you have to write them as a separate program, then add a bunch of stuff
[06:29] jesusabdullah: Still, once you have your stuff that helps
[06:30] jesusabdullah: I made my own "push" and "pop" for this last lab, helped clean up code a lot
[06:30] jesusabdullah: I love the DAQ assistant
[06:30] jesusabdullah: even if I wish thing would Just Work a little bit more often ;)

[06:37] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: You haven't?!?
[06:37] NuckingFuts: I mean, fuck, it crashes at least twice a day :/
[06:37] AAA_awright: All the cool kids switched long ago
[06:37] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: No, because I like my addons
[06:37] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: What add-ons
[06:37] jesusabdullah: I think chrome has add-ons now
[06:37] AAA_awright: You're a coward
[06:37] NuckingFuts: Greasemonkey (PROPER Greasemonkey)
[06:37] jesusabdullah: they're not nearly as popular, but you can get them!
[06:37] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Chrome has Greasemoney-style user scripts too
[06:37] jesusabdullah: I thought chrome at least half-assed supported greasemonkey scriptage
[06:38] NuckingFuts: half-assed
[06:38] AAA_awright: All the ones I've used work
[06:38] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: He DID say "PROPER" ;)
[06:38] AAA_awright: I wasn't aware of any problems
[06:38] AAA_awright: what about "proper"
[06:38] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Can't do GM_XHR
[06:38] NuckingFuts: That severely cripples it
[06:38] AAA_awright: I'm not aware of what that means
[06:38] jesusabdullah: GM_XHR?
[06:38] AAA_awright: And it's never cripples me
[06:38] AAA_awright: *crippled
[06:38] NuckingFuts: Greasemonkey scripts, since they're sandboxed, can use cross-domain XHR
[06:39] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: What are you doing anyways, it's a WEB BROWSER
[06:39] AAA_awright: Just switch the thing
[06:39] AAA_awright: It'll even import your cookies for you
[06:39] AAA_awright: and such
[06:39] jesusabdullah: idk man, if you're got some crazyinsane greasemonkey stuff going on...
[06:39] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Lots of GM scripts use GM_XHR
[06:39] jesusabdullah: What greasemonkey scripts are you using?
[06:39] NuckingFuts: Plus dAmnGoodies doesn't work on Chrome, and I don't think I can live without that >_>
[06:40] jesusabdullah: Also, are you sure chrome doesn't have GM_XHR right now?
[06:40] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Alright, and what, lots of things use lots of things
[06:40] NuckingFuts: Nobody's sure WHY it doesn't work
[06:40] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: Yup, since they're not sandboxed
[06:40] jesusabdullah: Ah
[06:40] jesusabdullah: What's DamnGoodies?

[06:40] AAA_awright: I've been on IRC for 5-7 years and DeviantArt for 6 months and I still have no clue, jesusabdullah
[06:40] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: A user script for deviantART chat lol
[06:41] NuckingFuts: There's SuperdAmn & dAmnGoodies, those are the top 2 GM scripts for deviantART chat
[06:41] jesusabdullah: I do recommend giving Chrome a shot though, even given that a significant percentage of GM scripts no worky. It's fast and pretty and pretty much pwns face
[06:41] jesusabdullah: imo
[06:41] jesusabdullah: dA chat? PFFFFFFFFSHT
[06:41] jesusabdullah: irc is the only real chat.
[06:42] NuckingFuts: I do use Chrome as a secondary browser
[06:42] AAA_awright: I know right
[06:42] NuckingFuts: I disagree
[06:42] jesusabdullah: facebook chat is only permissible because my family is on there
[06:42] NuckingFuts: IRC is crippled compared to dAmn
[06:42] jesusabdullah: *armcross*
[06:42] AAA_awright: That's not real chat anyways
[06:42] AAA_awright: That's just IM
[06:42] AAA_awright: IRC is chat.
[06:42] jesusabdullah: All I know is
[06:42] EyePulp has joined the channel
[06:42] jesusabdullah: I can CHAT with my FACEBOOK FRIENDS
[06:42] NuckingFuts: deviantART Chat is incredibly powerful.  It's got images, thumbs, etc., and a badass UI
[06:42] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: s/chat/instant message/
[06:43] NuckingFuts: I'd take the dAmn UI over mIRC any day of the weel
[06:43] NuckingFuts: *week
[06:43] jesusabdullah: NOPE
[06:43] jesusabdullah: heh
[06:43] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: UI isn't part of a chat protocol, NuckingFuts
[06:43] NuckingFuts: However, I'd take the IRC server over dAmn's too
[06:43] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Ah true
[06:43] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: My client also has images and thumbnail previews
[06:43] NuckingFuts: I quite enjoy the dAmn privclassing system too
[06:43] jesusabdullah: I actually always thought it'd be cool to make an irc client that automatically opens and inlines images
[06:43] jesusabdullah: Downside: no stopping a goatse
[06:43] AAA_awright: You should try Quassel it's fun
[06:43] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Not thumbnail previews, art thumbs :P
[06:44] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Well how would any application know how to process a DA-specific thumbnail
[06:44] muhqu has joined the channel
[06:44] AAA_awright: I don't know of the src URL for a thumbnail off the top of my head
[06:44] AAA_awright: Do you take the artwork URL and transform it somehow
[06:44] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: On deviantART chat?  Because it provides all the require variables lol
[06:44] jesusabdullah: Someone should make an irssi plugin that recognizes image urls, downloads the image, runs it through an ASCIIfier and prints it to your screen
[06:44] NuckingFuts: It turns it into something we call a "tablump"
[06:45] jesusabdullah: That would rock
[06:45] Aria: Hee. Like Textual only text-only.
[06:45] jesusabdullah: Textual?
[06:45] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: In any event you could probably modify a client to do that, and again that's DA-specific so I'm not conserned, as far as I am conserned that's no feature for chat
[06:45] Aria: MacOS IRC client.
[06:45] AAA_awright: That's just a DA feature, not a chat feature
[06:45] Aria: Displays images inline.
[06:45] jesusabdullah: Ah
[06:45] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Plus, the privclass system
[06:45] jesusabdullah: NuckingFuts: Get Textual!
[06:45] NuckingFuts: That system is beautiful.
[06:45] AAA_awright: I don't know what that is
[06:45] amerine has joined the channel
[06:45] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Why is that useful
[06:45] jesusabdullah: NuckingFuts: Explain privclasses.
[06:45] NuckingFuts: Beats the hell out of +v and shit
[06:46] jesusabdullah: Ah
[06:46] NuckingFuts: You divide a chat into ranks, and put users into those ranks
[06:46] AAA_awright: Something a bit more helpful, a link maybe
[06:46] jesusabdullah: I bet you would like gamesurge's chanserv then
[06:46] jesusabdullah: You can give a ranking anywhere between 1 and 500
[06:46] jesusabdullah: 500 being automatic owner
[06:46] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Yeah IRC has more than +o and +v, that's just what Freenode uses
[06:46] jesusabdullah: and then set different levels for different things
[06:46] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it's actually pretty versatile that way
[06:46] jesusabdullah: A lot of other servers also have half-ops
[06:46] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: That's an awful way to d oit
[06:47] jesusabdullah: Yeah, possibly
[06:47] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: A privclass can have anywhere from 0 to 99 (or infinite) thumbs, emotes, etc.
[06:47] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: Unreal uses owner, administrator, operator, halfop, voice, maybe moderator?
[06:47] NuckingFuts: So you can only post a certain number of a thing in a message before the system just leaves it as text
[06:47] jesusabdullah: I'm just point out that you can basically make up all the categories you want
[06:47] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: That sounds like eye candy, not a chat feature
[06:47] jesusabdullah: and you can even change the cutoffs
[06:47] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Talk in terms of chat features, what is IRC missing as an intrinsic part of the protocol
[06:47] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: The privclass stuff?  Not at all
[06:48] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I dunno, an actual account system?  Or how about chats that don't disappear?
[06:48] AAA_awright: And not just an extension or a website-specific integration (which IRC could do)
[06:48] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: That's a limitation in IRC servers and the topology, not the IRC protocol
[06:48] NuckingFuts: We've got a damn good protocol going here, man
[06:49] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: But I'm with you on that, NickServ is STUPID
[06:49] NuckingFuts: dAmn has a huge bot dev community lol
[06:49] jesusabdullah: Doesn't change the fact that freenode is a more limited experience than dA's thing might be
[06:49] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: I thought that ran on IRC in any event
[06:49] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Really? lolnope
[06:49] jesusabdullah: NuckingFuts: If that runs on IRC I can ircrpc them! >:D
[06:49] NuckingFuts: I'm recoding a server for it :P
[06:49] jesusabdullah: Fucking not-on-irc bots
[06:49] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: http://help.deviantart.com/317/
[06:49] jesusabdullah: Can you make it run on irc in the background, NuckingFuts ?
[06:50] jesusabdullah: Pweez?
[06:50] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah:What?
[06:50] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: The IRC server is dead nowadays
[06:50] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: http://frozenpandaman.deviantart.com/art/Connect-to-dAmn-using-IRC-86020582
[06:50] NuckingFuts: Ever since they created dAmn those few years ago
[06:50] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: That's an abstraction layer
[06:50] NuckingFuts: It will port between the protocols.  There's a guy in one of my chats on there who's made a new one in Ruby.
[06:51] jesusabdullah: You said you're recoding a server. You should recode it so that it's an irc server. ^__^
[06:51] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: You're still not demonstrating any shortcoming to IRC (which it DOES HAVE) that DA solved
[06:51] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: Tempting, but I'm lazy

[06:51] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: Is that the point, though?
[06:51] AAA_awright: That's my point
[06:51] jesusabdullah: The point is that he likes the dAmnthing
[06:51] NuckingFuts: dAmn has logging in.  'nuff said
[06:51] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: IRC has logging in
[06:51] NuckingFuts: Also lacks netsplits, though those are pretty rare nowadays lol
[06:52] NuckingFuts: Though I imagine irchighway still gets them 24/7
[06:52] jesusabdullah: netsplits are just due to having multiple servers making a network losing connectivity. That could happen with any system where the boxes are loosely tied together.
[06:52] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Netsplits are due to the topology?
[06:52] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: You imply you can't authenticate over IRC
[06:53] hebz0rl has joined the channel
[06:53] jesusabdullah: Chances are, dA's deal is a lot more centralized than the average irc network
[06:53] jesusabdullah: Alright, well, this conversation BORES me
[06:53] NuckingFuts: It is
[06:53] NuckingFuts: One server
[06:53] jesusabdullah: so I'm out of here
[06:53] NuckingFuts: in C-something
[06:53] NuckingFuts: That crashes
[06:53] AAA_awright: Besides PASS and SASL and the hack of sending a PRIVMSG at connect time you can also authenticate with client SSL certificates
[06:53] NuckingFuts: About thrice an hour
[06:53] jesusabdullah: A bottle of stoli raspberi is calling my name
[06:53] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: That's hackery
[06:53] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: I'm on an IRC network with two servers, last netsplit was... never?
[06:54] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: SASL is hackery? Client SSL certificates is HACKERY?
[06:54] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: There's a point where lodging your dick into the protocol and hoping it doesn't break anything isn't as effective as just starting from scratch
[06:54] NuckingFuts: IRC is kludged and taped to no end
[06:54] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: SSL is about as secure and non-hackery as you can get
[06:55] AAA_awright: Cookies when you log into websites is hackery
[06:55] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Still doesn't make it any less of a hack to use NickServ
[06:55] NuckingFuts: cookies are nothing, merely a header ;)
[06:55] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: No one said anything about NickServ
[06:55] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Then how are you authenticating over SSL again? >_>
[06:55] AAA_awright: There's no reason you can't authenticate without a bot like NickServ
[06:56] NuckingFuts: Except that'd be a protocol extension, which involves (drumroll please) HACKERY!
[06:56] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Send your client certificate signature at SSL connection time
[06:56] emattias has joined the channel
[06:56] AAA_awright: A number of clients support it, Freenode supports client certificates I thought (I don't use it)
[06:56] AAA_awright: Maybe it does't
[06:56] AAA_awright: It supports SSL at the very least
[06:56] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: That's not using SSL for what it was intended for, I'd imagine :O
[06:57] NuckingFuts: ... I've gotten far too used to the deviantART emotes lol
[06:57] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts:  Uh yes, SSL was intended for authentication
[06:57] NuckingFuts: :O doesn't look like a blowjob on there.
[06:57] AAA_awright: Not just encryption
[06:57] ajnasz has joined the channel
[06:57] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Not for logging in, though
[06:57] AAA_awright: Yes, logging in too
[06:57] AAA_awright: You can do it on websites too
[06:57] zylo has joined the channel
[06:58] dandean has joined the channel
[06:58] AAA_awright: A website can send you a client certificate or you can generate one which you use to login in the future
[06:58] AAA_awright: It's done above the HTTP layer at the SSL layer
[06:58] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Plus, most people can't generate a certificate lol
[06:58] AAA_awright: And Node.js supports it too
[06:58] niftylettuce: hey I have a website builder practically, building it in node.js, I want to figure out the best way to do templating for user's sites
[06:58] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: That's my only problem with Chrome, it doesn't support SSL certificates on Linux
[06:58] niftylettuce: do I have a static file called template.html and then do like %css% and %header% where the content would go?
[06:59] niftylettuce: what is a good method of templating such as this based off data in a mysql db?
[06:59] NuckingFuts: I use EmbeddedJS, other people swear by Jade
[06:59] AAA_awright: I swear by Jade
[06:59] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: But if you already have the HTML you probably want ejs
[06:59] AAA_awright: er, niftylettuce ^
[06:59] jesusabdullah: I've used jade, it's alright
[06:59] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce: Yeah, EJS is probably easier, like AAA_awright said :B
[06:59] niftylettuce: what is difference?
[06:59] jesusabdullah: I've heard mixed things about ejs
[07:00] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: If you can't generate a certificate the server can generate one for you
[07:00] AAA_awright: I've setup Nginx to do that
[07:00] jesusabdullah: My impression is that ejs is kinda like php's built-in templating, y'know?
[07:00] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce http://jade-lang.com
[07:00] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: There's also an initiative called WebID to authenticate people by SSL client certificates instead of passwords... somehow
[07:00] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: Yeah, that's part of why I like it
[07:00] AAA_awright: I plan on supporting it
[07:00] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I like OAuth myself
[07:00] elarson has joined the channel
[07:00] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: It seems like it should be easier than that though, for the average person. Generating certificates sounds pesky
[07:01] NuckingFuts: I think that's the best web-based method right now
[07:01] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: OAuth is meh, I plan on supporting that too though
[07:01] jesusabdullah: ANYWAYS
[07:01] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: I mean, OAuth is better than anything else out there
[07:01] NuckingFuts: OpenID is pretty damn good too
[07:01] AAA_awright: Short of SSL
[07:01] NuckingFuts: but it's just so unfriendly
[07:01] AAA_awright: OpenID is more irrelevant
[07:01] niftylettuce: what is better direction, ejs or jade???
[07:01] AAA_awright: It is rather unfriendly
[07:01] niftylettuce: ejs looks easier
[07:01] niftylettuce: jade looks complicated syntax
[07:01] AAA_awright: niftylettuce: Jade is beautiful
[07:01] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce: If you already have the HTML, go with EJS.
[07:01] AAA_awright: But if you already have the HTML go with NuckingFuts
[07:02] niftylettuce: lol
[07:02] jesusabdullah: anyways, lettucedude, jade is a dsl that compiles to html, while ejs is more like ye standard templates
[07:02] NuckingFuts: <%= css %>
[07:02] AAA_awright: ^
[07:02] jesusabdullah: so it depends on what you want/like
[07:02] NuckingFuts: And then load her up with the css variable equal to your thingy for the mySQL DB
[07:02] NuckingFuts: etc.
[07:02] jesusabdullah: Me, I prefer jade because I don't have to do close-tags. TWT takes care of stuff
[07:02] NuckingFuts: I've got sleep to do lol
[07:02] jesusabdullah: but, y
[07:02] Casperin has joined the channel
[07:02] jesusabdullah: but, y'know, whatever works for you, works for you!
[07:02] NuckingFuts: I don't mind closing tags, I got used to them lol
[07:03] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Normally when you connect to a site with HTTPS, SSL verifies the identity of the server to your client, but SSL can just as well be used the other way to verify the identity of the client to the server
[07:03] niftylettuce: ejs doesnt have github?
[07:03] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Aye, but that's a PITA
[07:03] AAA_awright: It does NuckingFuts
[07:03] AAA_awright: it does niftylettuce
[07:03] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce: Do you have a server?
[07:03] niftylettuce: NuckingFuts: yeah
[07:03] xandy has joined the channel
[07:03] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce: Are you using something like ExpressJS?
[07:03] niftylettuce: NuckingFuts: no I'm using all custom using node, html5 boilerplate
[07:03] jesusabdullah: NuckingFuts: Sure, I'm just lazy is all XD
[07:04] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: How is that a PITA? Server asks for your identity, the user agent asks the user "Hey what identiy do you want to use?" user selects one and bam, you're authenticated to the server
[07:04] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: lol I also like syntax highlighting
[07:04] AAA_awright: Setting it up might be a PITA
[07:04] niftylettuce: using connect.CreateServer
[07:04] AAA_awright: But it's WAY WAY WAY easier for identifying
[07:04] NuckingFuts: niftylettuce: Oooooh! You're using Connect?
[07:04] jesusabdullah: Well
[07:04] niftylettuce: NuckingFuts: yeah, is that bad?
[07:04] jesusabdullah: I shouldn't have to do things that are a pain in the ass.
[07:04] AAA_awright: niftylettuce: No nonsense that's great
[07:04] NuckingFuts: Is the EJS parser available on the Connect layer?
[07:05] NuckingFuts: Or just when you have Express on top of it?
[07:05] niftylettuce: idk i need a hand
[07:05] NuckingFuts: We all need hands
[07:05] NuckingFuts: Otherwise we couldn't type
[07:05] NuckingFuts: It'd be all like "adghaav basgaslgh" instead of "hello"

[07:18] loungin has joined the channel

[07:19] pquerna: v8
[07:19] v8bot: pquerna: undefined
[07:19] ryah: i suppose one way of doing this would be to expose certain objects to a separate context
[07:19] ryah: and be its runloop
[07:20] pquerna: i think it might be interesting to just port php.
[07:20] ryah: every once in a while it will hit a blocking function which would return control to the main node loop
[07:20] pquerna: exact syntax, not the stdlib.
[07:20] pquerna: right
[07:20] ryah: so you could write a little scheduler in node
[07:21] ryah: and use node libraries
[07:21] pquerna: making up a new language is fun, just not... reasonable.
[07:21] ryah: yeah, doing it in JS with contexts is good.

[10:16] clip: V1: ah ok. the problem was the debian server had the latest openssl installed, but somehow the nodejs compiler didn't recognize it and it had to do it without

[12:07] asdfsafdsa: uh huh
[12:10] V1: at least.. thats how I share my Node.js code with my client code :o
[12:11] asdfsafdsa: could you give an example of a time you've shared it?
[12:12] tiemonster has joined the channel
[12:16] V1: I use that technique to share my validations, my utilities and translations 
[12:16] V1: This way i don't have to use crapy client side module loaders, and still be able to share the code

[13:37] xandrews has joined the channel
[13:37] random123: JimBastard well, not sure yet exactly, but - I heard node.js is great for using long polling, is that true? So if so, I need the server to talk to PHP/MySQL - am I doing this wrong?
[13:37] wink_: yes and probably
[13:38] random123: Is there a better way to do long polling/Comet with PHP/MySQL? I heard Apache/mod_php has problems with long polling
[13:38] V1: long polling:?
[13:38] V1: use socket.oi
[13:38] JimBastard: random123: if you are running it through your lamp stack, you are going to run into the same issues
[13:38] wink_: random123: why do you need node to talk with php?
[13:38] wink_: node can directly access your dbs
[13:38] JimBastard: random123: you should setup a socket server using socket.io and then use node-http-proxy to forward everything else to your lamp stack
[13:38] JimBastard: or just not use php at all
[13:38] JimBastard: and apache
[13:39] JimBastard: kill both of them
[13:39] JimBastard: use node + mysql
[13:39] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[13:39] random123: Do you think that would be better? I'm just trying to use Node.js to have really effective long polling to serve Comet chat service, and a lot more in real time
[13:40] brianmario: how's the performance of node-mysql these days?
[13:40] random123: Maybe 500+ users at a time
[13:40] xastey has joined the channel
[13:40] wink_: brianmario: probably not so good :p, thats the one implemented in pure js ?
[13:40] brianmario: I think so
[13:40] guybrush: if you want to access php locally maybe you can do ChildProcess.spawn() and access your php stuff that way :p
[13:40] x_or has joined the channel
[13:40] wink_: yeah, performance is probably not its strong suit
[13:41] brianmario: but it's non-blocking as a result right? the ones that use libmysql have to deal with libmysql's blocking api
[13:41] guybrush: assuming there is lots of code which would have to be rewritten
[13:41] wink_: brianmario: http://github.com/w1nk/node-odbc  , it'll work with mysql, probably out performs the pure js binding, and doesnt block :p
[13:42] wink_: although the ones that bind to libmysql dont necessarily have to block just because the libs do
[13:42] wink_: most lib based bindings work around that relatively easily with eio
[13:42] brianmario: oh that's true
[13:42] brianmario: forgot that was in node
[13:42] brianmario: well
[13:43] random123: I am using iosocket though, however I heard to use Apache would be bad for Comet
[13:43] brianmario: I'll check that out, eio looks interesting
[13:43] wink_: apache+mod_php definitely shits the bed for long polling
[13:44] wink_: if you want a chat server, there are tons of them implemented in node
[13:45] random123: I have to build it myself, its not built yet, but it has specific functionality so building it in JS with node.js is definately an option and I will if its the most effective

[13:46] wink_: chat servers are node's hello world :p
[13:46] random123: I have very specific functionality I need, so using someone elses might not fit my arch and will require me to understand theirs intimately anyway, to the point i might as well have wrote it

[14:14] Aikar: your running an ancient node :P
[14:14] crazed: looks like i need to source install :)
[14:15] Aikar: yep, node has to be compiled from source
[14:15] Aikar: or get the 3rd party updated repo for ubuntu if thats where you got it
[14:15] crazed: i got it from the stock repo
[14:15] Aikar: someone has a repo they keep sorta up to date
[14:15] Aikar: but id recommend just compiling from source

[14:17] crazed: is it actually unstable though
[14:17] crazed: if not i'm fine just doing it from git

[14:20] Aikar: sendark: contain all of your files/dependencies etc into 1 folder and push that to server? :P as for compiling node if its same distro (build server) can compile node and make it part of the package too

[14:34] Aikar: http keepalive can make apache look faster
[14:34] Aikar: actually now apache is showing 0.063ms
[14:34] eldios: random123, be also aware that some provider (especially mobile providers) makes QoS for HTTP traffic (port 80)
[14:35] Aikar: apache prolly cached the file from disk
[14:35] Aikar: and yeah that
[14:35] Aikar: 8080 is usually used for proxy traffic so it could be depriortized by your isp
[14:36] random123: Oh, I see, I'm going to test it on 80
[14:36] Aikar: running 'time curl' is a better way to test anyways
[14:36] eldios: could be a better test
[14:37] eldios: also using curl is far better than visually comparing

[15:07] newy_ has joined the channel
[15:07] eldios: modules you're going to use system-wide all time long

[15:09] eldios: also note that I *SUPPOSE* npm does not update every and each package you have installed locally in your system

[16:00] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[16:00] zilch: eldios, why so ?
[16:00] eldios: two reasons
[16:00] mnutt: brianc: cool, I may switch to that from the pg gem. my issue is that I'm trying to use cluster to fork processes, and it doesn't have a way to asynchronously call http.createServer
[16:00] eldios: 1) nerds (they use weird words)
[16:00] eldios: 2) other languages support
[16:00] mnutt: which is really more of an issue with cluster than with pg
[16:00] zilch: eldios, lol
[16:01] brianc: why do you need to async call http.createServer?
[16:01] eldios: so how could you achieve a working software? easy peasy.. give partecipants (other than actual player) the possiblity to validate the actual word
[16:01] zilch: eldios, as someone who is always involved with bringing other language up ... I know how much it means
[16:01] mnutt: but I was hoping for a way to either start the postgres connection lazily or synchronously, so that the http server doesn't start listening before postgres is connected
[16:02] dmcquay_ has joined the channel
[16:02] zilch: eldios, but that will make game two slow, wouldn't it ?
[16:02] eee_c has joined the channel
[16:02] eldios: so match is 3 player? player 1 turn? ending letter 'n'? player 1 says "NodeJS" .. player 2 and 3 press green button
[16:02] eldios: player 1 scores
[16:02] amerine has joined the channel
[16:03] Sbioko has left the channel
[16:03] brianc: mnutt: you can use "pg.connect('connectionstring', function(error, client) { ... })" to have a "lazy" connection to postgres.  
[16:03] eldios: if you fear so (cause of the player interaction delay) just make a different version not dictionary based
[16:03] eldios: so at the beginning you can choose "dictionary match" "nerdy-weird-words match"

[16:06] brianc: mnutt: hmmm I'm not fully understanding what you're trying to go for. 
[16:06] Aikar: pyrotechnick1: i dont understand how npm 1.0 is causing you problems O.o? it installs modules in a way Node 0.4.x desires, whats the issue?
[16:07] mnutt: so cluster (http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/api.html) wants me to change my app so that I export the http server:  module.exports = http.createServer(....);
[16:07] brianc: yeah
[16:07] mnutt: then it takes that export and immediately calls listen()
[16:08] MikeW has joined the channel
[16:08] brianc: totaly
[16:08] pyrotechnick1: Aikar: it's not that hard to understand, you install something and it doesnt include, what gives?
[16:08] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[16:08] zilch: eldios, dinner time, sorry to not reply , brb
[16:08] Aikar: pyrotechnick1: did it install to project/node_modules/modulename ?
[16:08] eldios: ;)
[16:08] mnutt: so there's no way to do  module.exports = http.createServer(....) inside of a callback
[16:08] brianc: and it forks your process like x number of times where x is number of cores you have
[16:08] pyrotechnick1: Aikar: i tried all kinds of combinations of global and local installs, spent an entire day trying 1.0 before we went back
[16:08] mnutt: so my http server immediately starts listening and trying to serve requests
[16:09] brianc: mnutt: yeah exporting something pretty much requires what youre exporting already exists
[16:09] Aikar: if you cd to project dir, type 'npm install socket.io', then in your project require('socket.io') it should work
[16:09] brianc: mnutt: yeah
[16:09] brianc: so where does the issue with postgres enter?
[16:09] Aikar: well, npm may require your project have a package.json
[16:09] brianc: your server is now forked 3 times and listening
[16:09] pyrotechnick1: Aikar: i understand how to use it Aikar, it's not a problem with how i'm operating it
[16:09] pyrotechnick1: it's a problem with how it operates
[16:09] brianc: so far so good
[16:09] brianc: first request comes in
[16:09] Aikar: if it doesnt work, then it is a bug and you should identify it and report it
[16:09] mnutt: brianc: the very first request, the database hasn't yet connected
[16:09] brianc: you call "pg.connect(...)" and do your database goodness
[16:10] mnutt: oh, just do pg.connect on each request?
[16:10] pyrotechnick1: Aikar: thanks bro
[16:10] brianc: yes
[16:10] mnutt: ahhhh
[16:10] mnutt: got it
[16:10] brianc: pg.connect will create a set number of connections to the databsae
[16:10] brianc: after the number is reached
[16:10] pyrotechnick1: Aikar: was totally wondering to do when i found a bug
[16:10] brianc: further calls to "pg.connect" will wait until a connection becomes free
[16:10] mnutt: oh excellent, that's what I was not understanding
[16:10] brianc: the waiting is, of course, non blocking
[16:10] mnutt: yeah, that's fine
[16:10] mnutt: thanks!
[16:11] brianc: so let's say you have 1,000 connections to your web server, and you can only have 10 connections to postgres, then those 10 will be used to serve each 1,000 requests, 1 at a time, in the order the "pg.connect" call is queued up
[16:11] mnutt: I knew there was something I was missing, since this is such a common use case

[17:00] piscisaureus: oh
[17:01] prettyrobots: I can write this test.
[17:01] piscisaureus: will try to fix that tonight (CET)
[17:01] prettyrobots: CET?

[17:08] prettyrobots: Okay.
[17:10] piscisaureus: prettyrobots: that error-related api stuff might be unclear because we couldn't we weren't getting there so we moved back to irc. Anyway this is what we decided
[17:10] prettyrobots: I feel like once I get through the cycle of a patch, no matter how trivial, it will help me focus on writing tests, and less on git, Visual Studio, etc.
[17:11] perezd has joined the channel
[17:11] prettyrobots: Okay. Great. I'll focus there.
[17:12] piscisaureus: - if a function fails immediately it returns -1.
[17:12] piscisaureus: - If a pending operation fails the callback is called with status -1.
[17:12] piscisaureus: - oio_last_error() can be used to retrieve the error codes.
[17:12] piscisaureus: - oio_last_error() returns a struct with one public member which is called `code`. That one stores a cross-platform error code.
[17:12] piscisaureus: - A list of all the errors is in oio.h
[17:13] perezd: so any status on SPDY protocol for node?
[17:13] prettyrobots: I'm reading back through our exchange. And no I didn't mean to say tests are mine don't touch them. But, did we agree that I could implement at least part of test for errno checking?

[18:06] xandrews has joined the channel

[18:07] TomsB: It's not killing the server but I;m wondering why it happens
[18:07] mjr_: brianc: not yet

[18:07] TomsB: readyState is open when this happens
[18:07] brianc: mjr_: I'm the lead developer at the largest non medical transcription company in the US
[18:07] V1: TomsB: report a bug github issues 
[18:07] TomsB: ok
[18:08] V1: The readyState not be open, if the .end() method is called.
[18:08] brianc: mjr_: if you are still looking for a partner, shoot me an email if you'd like: brian.m.carlson@gmail.com
[18:08] isaacs: systemfault: in v8, it IS significantly faster to use constructed objects than literals, even if they don't add much.
[18:08] isaacs: systemfault: but if you only have a few objects, then it doesn't matter.
[18:08] isaacs: systemfault: also, sometimes instanceof is handy, and you need to have a prototype/constructor to do that
[18:08] systemfault: isaacs: So, if you needed a "vector" type object, you'd use classical inheritance?
[18:08] zzak has joined the channel

[18:10] systemfault: isaacs: But thank you for your answers :)
[18:10] zilch: I may be asking an odd question, but do you feel there is a need of consolidation among various modules , as there is many a times functionality overlap
[18:10] isaacs: for me, the first item on that list was about 4 years, then the rest have all been a year or two of programming js full time.
[18:11] isaacs: year or two each, that is
[18:11] TomsB: V1: I'm checking readyState right before socket.write() and it is "open"

[18:42] lalithmaddali: I have a problem  with loading redis with 50000 keys using node and node_redis with hiredis by mranney. When I put value for each Key as 4kb of dummy data it takes 30 minuites to load the database. Some times it takes 10 seconds. How do I overcome this odd behavior?

[18:43] Rubikzube: or just a common paradigm?
[18:44] mikey_p: typical for any *nix program
[18:44] pyrotechnick1: most shells will send the foregrounded process a sigint on control-c

[18:49] pyrotechnick1: you mean for redis to start back up?
[18:49] pyrotechnick1: or to fetch the data from redis via node_redis
[18:49] lalithmaddali: no just to set 50000 keys into redis
[18:50] lalithmaddali: fetching data is actually fast.. when i simultaneously run another client to fetch data..
[18:50] mjr_: lalithmaddali: still on the phone, but I can talk to you about it in a sec

[18:54] prettyrobots: Which noder?
[18:54] pyrotechnick1: i forget who it is but he's been around here before
[18:54] prettyrobots: Ah.
[18:54] pyrotechnick1: he was talking about adding node for scripts instead of ruby
[18:54] pyrotechnick1: or as well as ruby
[18:54] mikey_p: almost all are improved by adding something like ZNC
[18:55] pyrotechnick1: it's a bit like that for OSX software
[18:55] pyrotechnick1: try like

[19:26] azend: what do you mean by inherit a data structure outside of the scope?
[19:27] nibblebot: i mean i want each of my http.get() calls to retain a different copy of the 'options' parameter within their respective scopes
[19:27] azend: welp, I just crashed synergy by openning too many sockets with ab
[19:27] nibblebot: currently only 'options' from the final for loop iteration is preserved
[19:28] azend: well if you're iterating, couldn't you just use an array of options objects?

[19:32] Xano: I'm looking for a way to parse a string into a DOM if possible, or return FALSE if it's not (invalid XML...). I'm trying o3-xml, but it throws an error, which stops the entire execution. Am I doing something wrong (I'm new to this), or should I use another library?
[19:32] gzmask: heyo folks, what's wrong with my ejs partial... it renders the same thing three times: https://github.com/gzmask/rlatern/blob/master/views/about.ejs#L1-3
[19:32] ckknight: nibblebot: for one, variables are function-scoped, not block-scoped, and for two, any references to variables are not copied, the references are kept to their outer-function-bound value
[19:33] ckknight: Xano: does it only throw if it's invalid?
[19:34] Xano: ckknight: afaik, yes
[19:34] ckknight: Xano: that's what try { } catch (err) { } is for, then

[19:38] nibblebot: whereas assignment just overwrites existing, yes?

[19:45] V1: tjholowaychuk: yup, that why i wondered if there was a `easy` way to export dox to markdown so I only have to generate documentation once
[19:45] jonaslund: ckknight: you cannot for example change variables from the repl that are used/declared inside the required file and not exported
[19:45] V1: and only have to maintain my JSDocs

[20:33] ckknight: brianc: to C#
[20:33] n2liquid: steveklabnik: aw =\ okay; I wonder how X over SSH works if SSH offers just a single data chan..
[20:33] brianc: ckknight: that's what I get paid to write
[20:33] n2liquid: oh wait
[20:33] steveklabnik: .net, java, and mostly php are all on that list, personall.y
[20:33] n2liquid: maybe I can make some sort of multiplexer
[20:33] baudehlo: mscdex: ever seen a maildir library for node? Google says no, so I'm hacking on one...
[20:33] ckknight: all our new stuff is C# and all our Python is no longer maintained (despite it being still used)
[20:34] steveklabnik: n2liquid: wouldn't everything just be going through the connection X makes?
[20:34] mscdex: baudehlo: no idea, never worked with smtp stuff before
[20:34] ckknight: brianc: it's really not a bad language, quite advanced, really, but I don't like all the baggage that goes along with it and its community
[20:34] brianc: ckknight: you could ask for a raise
[20:34] fidian: n2liquid - You could open a persistent connection, I believe, and then send files along it without having the SSL negotiation delay for them.  Or you can do port forwarding.  They all go through the one SSL connection, but can act as separate streams.
[20:34] mscdex: baudehlo: just strictly imap :)
[20:34] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[20:34] mikeal: pquerna: ssl question for you
[20:34] samsonjs has joined the channel
[20:34] baudehlo: I use maildir for my imap server :)
[20:34] n2liquid: steveklabnik: yeah, but if a big packet were to be sent it would stall all other commands or something
[20:34] brianc: ckknight: i really dislike the community...i will not take another job writing C# unless everything but the C# is good.  My current job is _awesome_ except for the .NET part 
[20:35] baudehlo: but I'm wondering if maidlir will make a good-enough queue for outbound mail.
[20:35] mikeal: or ryah or anyone who knows SSL real well
[20:35] steveklabnik: n2liquid: it sounds to me like you're trying to solve problems you don't have yet.

[20:35] brianc: ckknight: i would really like to do node consulting more thana nything so I'm working towards that
[20:35] ckknight: brianc: cool
[20:35] n2liquid: steveklabnik: what if I want to transfer a 1 GB file while issuing shell commands at the same time using the same connection? can I do that?
[20:35] Nohryb has joined the channel
[20:35] baudehlo: mscdex: fair enough. Oh well the goog isn't coming up with anything so I'll continue hacking.
[20:35] ckknight: I think I'm gonna work on making a few really cool things in node.js and publish them and use that as excuses for people to hire me :P
[20:36] fidian: n2liquid: man ssh_config and search for ControlMaster
[20:36] brianc: ckknight: C# isn't terrible...but asp.NET webforms is terrible
[20:36] n2liquid: fidian: I will, thx
[20:36] pquerna: mikeal: yo
[20:36] steveklabnik: n2liquid: my network fu isn't all that great. sounds like fidian's got you covered.
[20:36] mikeal: ok
[20:36] ckknight: brianc: yeah, I've had to work on a Community Server-based product, now we're doing ASP.NET MVC stuff, which is better, but still not great.
[20:36] mikeal: i've been given a "web certificate" and an "intermediate CA"
[20:36] n2liquid: steveklabnik: I hope, but thanks anyway
[20:37] mikeal: how the fuck do i get these in to something i can use as pems in node?
[20:37] steveklabnik: C# is a pretty reasonable language, but then you're on Windows, and/or supporting microsoft.
[20:37] n2liquid: fidian: I think that was bull's eye, thanks a lot!
[20:37] piscisaureus: prettyrobots: ping
[20:37] ckknight: microsoft isn't bad, but the community is vacuous
[20:38] mikeal: i also have access to download the primary and secondary cert authority
[20:38] mikeal: pquerna: ^^
[20:38] steveklabnik: ckknight: i haven't forgiven microsoft from the 90s. it happens.
[20:38] pquerna: mikeal: cat them together
[20:38] pquerna: mikeal: in order
[20:38] fidian: n2liquid:  Glad to help.  Now I wonder if anyone here can help me with my node problem ...
[20:38] mikeal: for real
[20:38] brianc: ckknight: yeah, and in general pretty hierarchical and ivory tower-esque 
[20:38] pquerna: yup
[20:38] pquerna: single crt file
[20:38] pquerna: and then use that as the cert file
[20:38] pquerna: and it should just work (tm)
[20:39] ckknight: brianc: I don't just mean inside the company.
[20:39] mikeal: node ssl will work with just a cert and not a key?
[20:39] n2liquid: fidian: I assure you I'm no guru (been on node for like one week, lol), but do you care to share? I'm curious
[20:39] sh1mmer: if you send custom file descriptors to a child process is there are reason you can no longer access stdin/out/err? https://gist.github.com/932771
[20:39] brianc: ckknight: me either, the .NET community, even open source, is in general much more "I'm smarter than you, suck my dick" than other communities 
[20:39] sh1mmer: if that expected behaviour?
[20:39] dcampano: first time trying to do an npm bundle, but it looks like it's making a ton of symbolic links
[20:39] pquerna: mikeal: well, you still need _your_ private key, but not the intermediate cert private key
[20:39] isaacs: dcampano: if you like bundle, get the 1.0 rc
[20:39] brianc: ckknight: anyways i'm done ranting. back to the C# I go
[20:40] pquerna: mikeal: so one cert file with all your certs, and then a single private key in the key file
[20:40] pquerna: mikeal: and then have node load both..
[20:40] isaacs: dcampano: it installs things locally by default, and doesn't make a ton of symlinks
[20:40] ckknight: brianc: I see it as more like: Oh, you have a library to do that that's faster than something MS did? That doesn't matter, I'll just use the one that MS made.
[20:40] fidian: Sure.  I have a proxy in node that forwards my request to another machine.  It works great, but doesn't reply with any data for requests that are both POST and that set a "Connection: close" header.
[20:40] isaacs: (just a few symlinks, for bins and such)
[20:40] dcampano: isaacs: thx!
[20:40] LSU_JBob has left the channel
[20:40] isaacs: dcampano: instructions in the readme on github
[20:40] isaacs: dcampano: it'll be the default in a few weeks.
[20:40] dcampano: isaacs: sounds good
[20:40] n2liquid: fidian: what about the snippets?
[20:41] duncanbeevers has left the channel
[20:41] dcampano: out of curiosity, is there an alternative to bundling for deploying apps?
[20:41] fidian: Snippets?  I can put the code online if you like and give you wget commands.
[20:41] n2liquid: fidian: yeap, please do
[20:41] duncanbeevers has joined the channel
[20:41] brianc: ckknight:  strongly typed anon methods + linq to objects is pretty nice. can almost get quasi-dynamic language out of C# if you bend it right
[20:41] n2liquid: fidian: you could also use pastebin.com, though..
[20:42] ckknight: oh, absolutely, the language and the BCL are quite amazing, brianc
[20:42] tylerflint has left the channel
[20:42] ckknight: brianc: but if you use dynamic programming in real contexts, you're a monster
[20:42] reid has joined the channel
[20:42] brianc: ckknight: but best thing: do as much clientside as you can. then you have lovely JS to work with. ;) then sneak in some node.exe once it works on windows and BOOM. you'll be a hero? 
[20:42] ckknight: brianc: not in my current job, anything like Node.js will be laughed at, regardless of benchmarks.

[20:48] n2liquid: aren't both the same?
[20:48] n2liquid: ah
[20:48] n2liquid: -0
[20:48] n2liquid: vs -O?
[20:48] piscisaureus: prettyrobots: win builds again so you're good to go
[20:48] fidian: Sorry - that's a mistake.  I was trying to use wget to send the "Connection: close" header, but it never did.  Please ignore the comments at the top.
[20:49] riven has joined the channel
[20:49] n2liquid: fidian: so is your problem solved?
[20:49] fidian: And using --no-http-keep-alive with wget just omits the "Connection: keep-alive" header and doesn't put in a "Connection: close" header.  I have a PHP script that does the headers correctly.
[20:49] riven has joined the channel
[20:49] fidian: No, not solved.  It's not really with wget.
[20:50] n2liquid: fidian: if you actually send Connection: close it still explodes, then?
[20:50] fidian: n2liquid:  Correct.
[20:50] pquerna: mikeal: hrm. no test case but..https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node_crypto.cc#L294
[20:50] n2liquid: fidian: okay, I'll check
[20:50] pquerna: mikeal: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node_crypto.cc#L215
[20:50] pquerna: mikeal: it really should be your cert, followed by your intermediate cert in a single file
[20:51] sh1mmer: If you pass custom file descriptors you still have 3 streams but there are no references to them
[20:51] mikeal: that's what i've got
[20:51] mikeal: maybe my private key is off 
[20:51] sh1mmer: that seems somewhat non-optimal
[20:52] mikeal: the private key is on it's own right, it's not relative to the CA or anything like that?
[20:52] tokumine has joined the channel
[20:52] n2liquid: fidian: did you check if the proxy server is being hit by the request or not?
[20:52] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: it is intended
[20:53] piscisaureus: sh1immer: but I agree there could be a more convenient api
[20:53] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[20:53] jeremy has joined the channel
[20:53] pquerna: mikeal: yea the private key is in a separate file
[20:53] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: I get that you can't assume that they are stdin/out/err but it doesn't seem right to not provide any reference to them
[20:54] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: the problem is that you cannot really "split" a stream
[20:54] mikeal: i know, but it's not generated relative to the CA or anything
[20:54] piscisaureus: sh1immer: when you pass [0, 1, 2] you're hooking the child up to the tty straigt, node is no longer in between
[20:54] piscisaureus: *straight
[20:54] mikeal: it's just basically a strong random key
[20:55] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: right
[20:55] fidian: n2liquid: Yes, it is hitting the proxy server and logging things to the console.
[20:55] random123: Can someone tell me what the error is on this script?
[20:55] random123: http://pastebin.com/fZ6wbB1z
[20:55] random123: I am getting syntax error line 1, unexpected token ")"
[20:55] n2liquid: fidian: the code you sent me is logging stuff to the console too?
[20:56] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: if you want to direct the output of the child to the tty *and* be able to use it from node you must not use customFDs; just use util.pipe(child.stdout, process.stdout)
[20:56] mnutt_: brianc: node-postgres should never make more than poolSize simultaneous connections to postgres, right? No matter what I set poolSize to, if I hit node with apachebench then postgres soon starts throwing "FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already"
[20:56] gozala has joined the channel
[20:56] jnjac: why does << $ node -e "console.log('test')" >> output test, and then undefined? instead of just test?
[20:57] n2liquid: fidian: @line 36, does "sys.log('< ' + chunk);" actually happen?
[20:58] fidian: n2liquid:  Yes, yours should log too.  Let me show my output from a get (with connection: close) and a post.
[20:58] brianc: mnutt_: are you using pg.connect("string", function(err, client) { ... }); or new pg.Client()?
[20:58] n2liquid: fidian: I'm not running the code here to test, sorry
[20:59] n2liquid: but this should be really easy to sort out
[20:59] brianc: jnjac: i think it outputs the value of the executed line as the last line of output
[20:59] mnutt_: brianc: the former
[20:59] jnjac: brianc: is there a way to suppress it?
[20:59] brianc: mnutt_: it will only open poolSize connections

[21:02] mnutt_: brianc: it happens even with poolSize of one, so it must be something else

[21:03] maushu_: wut
[21:03] maushu_: No.
[21:03] n2liquid: fidian: from what I can see the requesting party is closing the connection before you can send back the answer

[21:06] fidian: n2liquid:  I know the client is not closing the connection first - it is not timing out and I can insert delays and the request will happily wait as long as node isn't in the middle.
[21:06] mraleph: piscisaureus: should I practice my dutch in tweeter? 
[21:07] n2liquid: fidian: so the problem is node is issuing a spurious 'end' event, right?
[21:07] mraleph: piscisaureus:  :-)
[21:07] prettyrobots: Hmm... I'll take a quick look now and make sure I know what I'm looking at.

[21:09] n2liquid: problem is after that 'end' is fired

[21:11] mnutt_: brianc: aha, postgres's max connections were set to 20; bumped it up to 50 and no more issues

[21:14] Ori_P has joined the channel
[21:14] fidian has joined the channel
[21:15] fidian: n2liquid:  Correction, I think that the connection to the client is closed prematurely - at the "end" event before the server can reply with useful data.  So few things use "Connection: close" that I can imagine this scenario being overlooked.

[21:15] random123: How many ms should a call to node.js take to recieve?
[21:16] random123: Average everything
[21:16] n2liquid: fidian: I think for some reason node is actually closing the connection as soon as it receives any HTTP request with connection: close
[21:16] n2liquid: that'd be a bug
[21:16] ckknight: random123: depends. For my blog which does a DB request, it's <10 ms
[21:16] n2liquid: any node internals' gurus available?

[21:17] n2liquid: fidian: maybe you should fire a mail to node's mailing list?
[21:17] n2liquid: I don't see many complex troubleshooting happening here on the channel
[21:17] fidian: n2liquid:  See the log from the first request, a GET request with "Connection: close"
[21:18] n2liquid: fidian: yeah, it also closes too soon
[21:18] n2liquid: how does the data make its way to the client then? you said it worked with GET
[21:18] ckknight: random123: code looks fine, might be a server setup issue.  You should be able to pump thousands of requests a second with that code.
[21:18] pyrony has joined the channel
[21:19] fidian: n2liquid:  Yeah, the data does go back to the client.  The connection is still writable... odd.  Ok, I'll fire off an email.

[21:35] ckknight: techwraith: pshaw, I'll just git push to nodester and update _live_!
[21:36] techwraith: Yeah, I use no.de
[21:36] techwraith: But it would be cool to be able to do it without a deploy step
[21:36] piscisaureus: ckknight: intentional
[21:36] techwraith: This thing sets up a tunnel to your local machine
[21:36] ckknight: when I was at MIX, smarx did a cool chat demo using node running on Windows Azure and showed him updating it live (granted, this was a Windows Azure demo)
[21:37] techwraith: Plus, this was done with node :)
[21:37] piscisaureus: is there a "openssl for n00bs" guide somehere? Or at least a glossary? How am I supposed to know the difference between a PEM an a Hmac?
[21:38] mraleph: piscisaureus: rofl. you should be aware that many of those "erlang fanboys" have never ever launched a single erlang app into production :-)
[21:38] wink_: i think the guide was called "openssl is written by monkeys"
[21:40] piscisaureus: mraleph: then where does this erlang love come from? And btw, you read a book about it, does it do something "really cool" that node should do too?

[21:42] jonaslund: erlang is beautiful in it's own way, but damn annoying in some respects
[21:42] ckknight: its use of strings is infuriating
[21:42] ckknight: handling of strings, I mean

[21:54] JimBastard: isaacs: got ya
[21:55] techwraith: n2liquid`busy: What do you mean?
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: check out the vhost middleware
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: depending on your needs it may or may not work

[21:55] Majid has left the channel
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: it's in connect core

[21:58] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: would know better
[21:58] n2liquid`busy: he's always too busy I'm afraid to ask, lol
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: there are examples
[21:58] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: I see there are connect examples, but how do they fit with Express? I'm always at a loss there
[21:58] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[21:59] n2liquid`busy: I know it sounds silly because connect is there even with Express, but I still didn't zen the spirit of it
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: because connect is more of a utility framework
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: a framework framework
[21:59] mnemonic: tjholowaychuk> you are one of the authors of expressjs ?
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: mnemonic: yeah
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: and connect
[22:00] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: is there some place I can look up at connect things working on Express? just to get the idea
[22:00] techwraith: mnemonic: tj's pretty bad ass :P
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: things? middleware?
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: its just a function
[22:00] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: yeap
[22:00] ckknight: express is just built on top of connect, n2liquid`busy, it adds extra stuff but connect is always there
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: the request goes in, the function does stuff, calls next()
[22:00] ckknight: as I undestand it
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: and then the function below that via use() is called
[22:00] ckknight: request goes in response comes out, you can't explain that.

[22:01] mnemonic: seems to be very good
[22:01] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: ah, I see, and last thing the result goes to the app.get callback?
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: app.get() / put etc are all actually just middleware as well
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: just a nicer api for dealing with urls
[22:02] n2liquid`busy: I see
[22:02] techwraith: mnemonic: http://expressjs.com/applications.html
[22:02] random123: I'm not sure but I'm finally getting 10ms SSH from one box to another, but from my box I get 37ms which is probably because I am on wifi and maybe my ISP deprioritizing 8080 like you said because its a home connection
[22:02] ckknight: app.get() calls into connect-router
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:02] n2liquid`busy: but then I do app.use(vhost);
[22:03] mnemonic: techwraith> thanks
[22:03] n2liquid`busy: and then? how do I use that with app.get() to only pick the requests from the correct domain?
[22:03] ckknight: random123: okay, that makes a lot of sense. I'd recommend adding logging to your app to see how long it takes the server to generate the page. It should be sub-1ms
[22:03] sveimac has joined the channel
[22:04] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: sorry to bump, but did you see my question?
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: the docs are there my friend :p
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: or even open up the source for vhost.js

[22:04] tjholowaychuk: it's extremely simple
[22:04] NuckingFuts has joined the channel
[22:04] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: I've opened it, but I can't really digest the concept, so the source doesn't make much sense, but I'll try

[22:06] brianc: n2liquid`busy: you want to only respond to a particular vhost?
[22:07] n2liquid`busy: brianc: nope, I want to respond to many vhosts
[22:07] brianc: oh, just read the "host" header from the http request
[22:07] n2liquid`busy: brianc: but I only get to the host header when I already did routing :)
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: that's the point of the vhost() middleware
[22:08] n2liquid`busy: I want to set different URL routings for different vhosts, see?
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: it routes the entire server object
[22:08] brianc: create 2 separate apps, 1 for each vhost, and use the vhost middleware to mount each of them
[22:08] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: I know, but I still don't know how to put it below ExpressJS
[22:08] n2liquid`busy: so I'll like have different express apps for different vhosts
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-vhost.html
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: but instead of createServer()
[22:09] techwraith: n2liquid`busy: Not sure, but I think you have to create two express servers, one for each host
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: put app / app2 there
[22:09] mnemonic: tjholowaychuk> what are the options for data persistence ? and can I use Redis client for Node.js ?
[22:09] techwraith: mnemonic: Yep
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: mnemonic: lots of options these days, but yeah of course
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: node_redis is great
[22:09] brianc: var app1 = express.createServer...
[22:09] brianc: app1.get("/", ...);
[22:09] brianc: var app2 = express.createServer...
[22:09] brianc: app2.get("/",...);
[22:09] brianc: connect(connect.vhost("www.app1.com", app1), connect.vhost("www.app2.com", app2));
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: woah
[22:09] techwraith: mnemonic: You're in charge of all the persistance :)
[22:10] n2liquid`busy: brianc: and where do I listen?
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: mnemonic: oh, yeah express is not bound to a specific ORM or anything if that is what you meant
[22:10] kawohi: How do I end node http server?
[22:10] brianc: var server = connect(connect.vhost("www.app1.com", app1), connect.vhost("www.app2.com", app2));
[22:10] brianc: server.listen(port)
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: kawohi server.close()
[22:10] n2liquid`busy: brianc: ah, I see; and if I app2.listen() kitties die? XD
[22:10] mnemonic: so, I understand that VC is implemented via Templates (Views) and via logic (Controllers) but I am free for the data persistence (Model) ?
[22:11] brianc: basically everything in express/connect is a middleware, so you can stack, mount, whatever wherever you want. its rad

[22:11] v8bot:  n2liquid`busy has given a beer to brianc. brianc now has 2 beers.

[22:11] n2liquid`busy: (am I overusing this ++ thing?)

[22:11] n2liquid`busy: I feel like incrementing everyone that solves my problems, lol
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid`busy: yeah basically what that does is transforms several servers into the root connect() one
[22:12] fumanchu182 has joined the channel
[22:12] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: Related to the vhosts thing - is there any way to make one app and just get the subdomain/domain as a param?
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: the other servers basically just become callbacks
[22:12] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: good, now I get it, thanks
[22:12] brianc: techwraith: i think the domain/subdomain is in the req.headers('host')
[22:12] secoif has joined the channel
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: not sure what you mean, you can use req.subdomains
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: its an array
[22:13] techwraith: Ah, sweet, didn't know about that
[22:13] brianc: err...req.header
[22:13] techwraith: brianc: is the host header reliable?
[22:13] tjholowaychuk: i forget how it's parsed out, I believe if you have foo.bar.com you will get an array with foo and bar
[22:13] brianc: techwraith: browsers all send the host headers, curl and other things do not
[22:13] ckknight: techwraith: it should be, though if you use a proxy, there can sometimes be oddities
[22:13] n2liquid`busy: well, since nobody said anything about giving free beers to anyone I think's cool I'll just keep doing that
[22:13] n2liquid`busy: gonna get back to work, thx
[22:13] brianc: n2liquid`busy: ++
[22:13] brianc: whoops
[22:13] n2liquid`busy: haha
[22:13] brianc: i failed at that, therefore, no beer for you
[22:13] n2liquid`busy: (:
[22:13] n2liquid`busy: aosifgasif
[22:14] n2liquid`busy: lol, okay
[22:14] brianc: when I lose we all lose
[22:14] techwraith: brianc++
[22:14] v8bot:  techwraith has given a beer to brianc. brianc now has 1 beers.
[22:14] n2liquid`busy: I'm using medication anyway; can't have alcohol
[22:14] ckknight: techwraith: if a client supports HTTP 1.1, it should send the Host header. Regardless, don't expect it to always be there, so you should at least have error handling.
[22:14] ckknight: what kind of beers are people getting?
[22:14] brianc: ckknight: 512 IPA
[22:14] techwraith: of course, I was just wondering if I could rely on it being there most of the time

[22:19] n2liquid`busy: can I stack more middlewares on it?
[22:20] n2liquid`busy: like bringing up a third ExpressJS object?
[22:20] brianc: I would assume so but I'm not sure
[22:20] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: is it possible?
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: but they will be positioned at the bottom
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: so they might not be useful
[22:21] n2liquid`busy: tjholowaychuk: you mean if anything picks it before it reaches the bottom it will never be reached, right?
[22:21] n2liquid`busy: not a problem with stacking vhosts, I suppose
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: yeah that should be fine

[22:32] DoNaLd`: tjholowaychuk: but there persist another issue .. when i will call this my defined function over utils.add in grid-plugin.js file, which is included in stock_cards.ejs .. then i will always get this error message: utils is not defined
[22:32] Sonolin: yes, I'm using server.listen on an express server, just specifying the 'port' not the ip address
[22:32] Sonolin: I want the ipaddress in "ifconfig" for eth0
[22:33] brianc: Sonolin: as far as I can tell, express's server inherits from connect's server which intern inherits from http.Server.  Neither express nor connect override the "listen" method so all 3 of those servers' "listen" method should have the same api
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: DoNaLd`: well you have to think about what it's actually generating, requiring other modules etc wont always work
[22:33] Sonolin: sorry... http.createServer has the callback method i need
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: DoNaLd`: since it's obviously a different environment, still some things that could be improved though

[22:35] JulioBarros has joined the channel
[22:35] DoNaLd`: tjholowaychuk: ok .. so there is issue with restriction of express-expose ?
[22:35] harth has joined the channel
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: DoNaLd`: well not everything can magically work, nodes modules are not available etc
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: DoNaLd`: https://github.com/visionmedia/express-expose/issues/3
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: I could add that though so they can at least interact a bit better
[22:36] ckknight: Sonolin: you could `exec ipaddress eth0` :P
[22:36] jdp has joined the channel
[22:37] brianc: Sonolin: app.listen(3000, function() { console.log(app.address()) });
[22:38] Sonolin: thanks guys.. I guess I'll just have to execute the OS command ... didn't really want to do that as its not cross-compatible if a user is using windows/something other than eth0
[22:38] Sonolin: app.address() just returns 0.0.0.0
[22:39] Sonolin: maybe it'll help if I just explain what I'm trying to do ;)
[22:39] ckknight: "0.0.0.0" means it's listening on all IPs
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: 0.0.0.0 is INADDR_ANY no?
[22:39] ckknight: yeah
[22:39] DoNaLd`: tjholowaychuk: ok :/ so there exist some other method for this case .. without express-expose module ? i need send my function, which was defined in SSJS over my .EJS file into Client-Side javascript file ?
[22:39] colinclark has joined the channel
[22:39] Sonolin: I have an app with multiple "configs" in the database, and I want node.js to get a different config for different domain names
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: DoNaLd`: you could just toString() the function
[22:40] Sonolin: since I'm using Socket.IO I have to figure out a way to specify what domain/IP before the socket.io connection 
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: but like i said, its not magic
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: if the dependencies of your function(s) do not match it wont work
[22:40] Sonolin: and I don't want to just send the plaintext hostname to the server, because I'm trying to make it so I verify the app is actually on the right server
[22:41] DoNaLd`: tjholowaychuk: i understand
[22:41] harth has joined the channel
[22:42] DoNaLd`: tjholowaychuk: so :) .. do you have some deadline for implementation of this functionality into express-expose module ? :))
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: nope
[22:42] DoNaLd`: :>
[22:43] DoNaLd`: it was only joke :)

[22:58] ckknight: should application configuration be inside your repository? if so, why? if not, where should you put it?
[22:58] techwraith: ckknight: Depends on what you mean by config
[22:59] ckknight: like a JSON file or whatever that would contain data like DB connection string, secret keys, etc.
[22:59] techwraith: I usually keep a development.js in .gitignore and a development.js.template in the repo
[22:59] ckknight: yeah, I've seen that pattern and it seems sane
[22:59] skohorn has joined the channel
[22:59] ckknight: if you use something like nodester to publish, that means you have to maintain two separate git repos, which I'm trying to figure out a way to avoid.

[23:06] fromz: I need some basic image manipulation in node.js, but don't want to destroy nodes scalability. Have any of you used https://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick ?
[23:06] techwraith: fromz: Kills scalability
[23:07] techwraith: stay away from imagemagick in genereal
[23:07] fromz: image scaling isn't the main function of the app I'm writing - users do it once, and then they're scaled.
[23:07] techwraith: *general
[23:07] fromz: yeah that's what I was afraid of.
[23:08] fromz: do you know of any other image libraries that scale okay?
[23:08] techwraith: We use VIPS
[23:09] pcardune has joined the channel
[23:09] techwraith: Not very intuitive, and you have to exec out to it (but you'd have to do that for imageMagick as well)
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: techwraith at least then it's async :p haha
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: what is vips?
[23:09] fromz: yeah I'm searching for vips now 
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: fromz: could try node-canvas
[23:10] techwraith: Hard to find, one sec
[23:10] tjholowaychuk: though it is in-process so it will be faster, but also block the thread more
[23:10] fromz: thanks tjholowaychuk will look at that as well.
[23:10] onre has joined the channel
[23:10] fromz: I think I found vips at vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk - but I am forbidden hah.
[23:11] techwraith: Yeah, one sec
[23:11] techwraith: It's worth the wait, it's about 600% faster than image magic
[23:11] fromz: oh my.
[23:11] techwraith: brb
[23:12] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: might be cool to bundle cairo with node-canvas?
[23:12] chapel: tjholowaychuk: couldn't you just have a dedicated process for node-canvas? and just send jobs to it?

[23:26] nvardar has joined the channel
[23:26] wasabi has joined the channel
[23:26] Sonolin: The problem is for one of my methods, the POST body is rather large and takes ~.5 seconds on average to POST to the server
[23:26] SvenDowideit has joined the channel
[23:27] Sonolin: Can I somehow do this non-blocking so other reqests aren't as affected? Maybe I can spawn a web worker ON POST to the server (similarly to how I can do this for file uploads)?
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: Sonolin: what are you using that is blocking? bodyParser?
[23:28] Sonolin: Yea I'm using bodyParser so that might be what's blocking
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: you can just not using something that blocks :p but then you have to parse it on your own
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: yes
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: it buffers
[23:28] Sonolin: ok
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: it wont block
[23:28] Sonolin: ok I'm confused, does it block or not?
[23:28] ckknight: it won't
[23:28] Sonolin: ok odd
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: no but it will consume more mem
[23:28] ckknight: it buffers until it's received the 'end' event
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: and "block" that request
[23:29] tjholowaychuk: but not the whole event loop
[23:29] eddorre has joined the channel
[23:29] Sonolin: well, maybe what's blocking is when the POST data is sent back to Client 2?
[23:29] ckknight: once the 'end' event is received, it calls next() and the next middleware executes
[23:29] Sonolin: I'm using socket.io "client.send" for that
[23:30] Sonolin: what's happening is 1) big request body request comes in, the server hangs until that request is done, 2) next "small" chat request comes in, but has to wait for first request to finish
[23:31] ckknight: could you paste your code?
[23:31] Sonolin: I use bodyparser, get the request body, do some minor processing on it, and use "client.send" to send to client2
[23:32] Sonolin: http://jsfiddle.net/M3Qeb/
[23:32] Sonolin: and that callback is called from socket.io
[23:33] Sonolin: actually that would mean socket.io is the thing that is blocking it right?
[23:33] Sonolin: I'm sorry very very new to async programming here
[23:33] mscdex: js fiddle? is that a new kind of async musical instrument?
[23:34] Sonolin: no its a site to preview javascript code ;)
[23:34] eddorre: Hey everyone, I'm new at node.js and I'm trying to run some example code but node silently exits. Anyone have an idea why this it's not listening and waiting? https://gist.github.com/933332
[23:34] Sonolin: message.webcam is the big POST body I'm talking about 
[23:34] nvardar has joined the channel
[23:34] ckknight: Sonolin: what is client?
[23:35] Sonolin: client is the socket.io client instance
[23:36] briznad has joined the channel
[23:36] mscdex: eddorre: who knows, maybe it's not compatible with node 0.4.x
[23:36] mscdex: eddorre: contact the module author

[23:36] eddorre: Thanks.
[23:37] mscdex: node only exits when there's nothing else to do
[23:37] Sonolin: well I'll do some more testing with this... thanks guys
[23:37] ckknight: Sonolin: I'd put a console.log(new Date()) at the beginning and end of that function, see if it's actually blocking there.
