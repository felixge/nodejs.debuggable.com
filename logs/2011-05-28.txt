[01:46] DelvarWorld: I see a possible workaround as passing in the library I am requiring into that function when I call it, but I'm not sure why it can't find require

[01:47] adrianmg has joined the channel
[01:47] chjj: DelvarWorld: require is not a global, each module gets its own require function
[01:47] chjj: its passed in, modules are just functions that are executed with some parameters passed in

[01:49] chjj: what do you mean

[03:45] Bradleymeck: do you have a circular dependency?
[03:46] kcbanner: Hm. app.js requires util.js, and then models.js which in turn requires util.js (and in models.js, util is {}, while in app.js it is OK)

[03:48] Bradleymeck: ok, if i can get a good week to just run through it, i can prolly get it working again, pixel buffers were nice, but i still need to merge the 2 event loops
[03:49] kcbanner: Bradleymeck, oh, crap I do have a circular dep
[03:49] kcbanner: so how do I get around that?
[03:50] Bradleymeck: you can hold off on referencing the value's properties until it is done loading, or you can resolve the loop
[03:51] Bradleymeck: ACTION kinda wishes modules would fire a 'loaded' event that would propagate to process... but the need is rare if at all really

[04:12] razvandimescu: app.register '.html'

[05:21] kmiyashiro: niftylettuce: I'm pretty sure you can ref the parent in stylus somehow
[05:21] gtramont1na_: niftylettuce: Sure! You can always clone it from github and try it locally if you will. :-)
[05:21] gtramont1na_: niftylettuce: I'm just lacking of tests. :-( It all started with a Now.js spike.

[05:35] Aria: Which way around?
[05:35] Aria: PHP's functions do a dozen different things depending on flags.
[05:35] Viriix: yeah

[06:37] MooGoo: wtf is window.motion
[06:37] tmpvar: it's fairly well known, but i wanted exports to be a function
[06:38] tmpvar: window.motion is a lib im writing ;) -- sorry heh
[06:38] MooGoo: and your function seems to do nothing
[06:38] MooGoo: well
[06:38] MooGoo: no it makes exports an empty function
[06:38] isaacs has joined the channel
[06:38] MooGoo: it doesnt use the arg passed to it
[06:39] MooGoo: why not just...
[06:39] MooGoo: exports = function() {}
[06:39] MooGoo: that effectivly does the same thing
[06:39] tmpvar: MooGoo: https://github.com/tmpvar/motionjs/blob/master/lib/client.js#L60
[06:39] tmpvar: that is how its supposed to be
[06:39] tmpvar: you cant do exports = function() {} 
[06:40] tmpvar: :/
[06:40] tmpvar: because it doesnt hold its ref to the outer scope
[06:40] rbranson has joined the channel
[06:40] tmpvar: so you basically set a local var to a function and that is all
[06:41] MooGoo: it's a global var
[06:41] tmpvar: i'd have to pass module, and set .exports .. but that would break the browser case
[06:41] MooGoo: in the function
[06:41] tmpvar: it doesnt reference the original exports
[06:41] tmpvar: example..
[06:41] MooGoo: yes indeed
[06:41] MooGoo: I see it now
[06:42] MooGoo: so the function literally does nothing 
[06:42] tmpvar: yup
[06:42] MooGoo: I think I should add that line to some of my code
[06:42] tmpvar: javascript is silly ;)

[06:45] madsleejensen: Hi all, do any of you have a few suggestions on some opensource medium size projects that is implemented with nodejs. I would like to see how such project is structured etc. ?
[06:46] SubStack: tmpvar: you /could/ with browserify.bundle() but why?
[06:46] tk has joined the channel
[06:46] tmpvar: madsleejensen,  what sort of project?
[06:46] tmpvar: SubStack, why not?
[06:47] tmpvar: SubStack, another thing that strikes me as odd.. do you have to use connect?
[06:47] SubStack: because then you don't get the benefit of when you update the files the browserify.js changes
[06:47] SubStack: you can use any web stack that has connect-style .use()
[06:47] SubStack: express, stack, whatevs
[06:47] tmpvar: SubStack, in production i'd hate to have a file watcher going on
[06:47] SubStack: watch : false
[06:48] tmpvar: writeToFile : /path/to.file ?
[06:48] TomY: having issues with npm install of daemon (daemon-node) compiling for the wrong architecture. Node is compiled for i386 - is this typical (on a mac)?
[06:48] tmpvar: :P
[06:48] chapel: SubStack: cant you also just bundle and serve up the file however you want, with no web stack?
[06:48] TomY: i.e. should i try to make node x86_64, or try to get npm to match node?
[06:48] madsleejensen: tmpvar: any kind of project really :) im interrested in seeing how code is split up etc.  How they handle all this async, my javascript experience is limited to small web scripts
[06:48] SubStack: chapel: yes
[06:48] SubStack: browserify.bundle()
[06:48] tmpvar: ah
[06:48] chapel: you should make a cli tool for it :P
[06:49] tmpvar: there we go :)
[06:49] SubStack: I don't need one so I haven't written one

[06:51] TomY: ACTION suspects snowleopard upgrade...
[06:52] tmpvar: madsleejensen, so I'd probably take a peek at socket.io, connect, express, jsdom (hehe), node-http-proxy, mongo-native, etc..
[06:53] tmpvar: there is a huge list of modules.. but im guessing that is not what you are going for
[06:53] tmpvar: madsleejensen, here's a fun one: https://github.com/onedayitwillmake/RealtimeMultiplayerNodeJs
[06:53] SubStack: I wouldn't look at the big popular ones that have been around forever

[07:19] btipling: but no proxy
[07:19] giby: i have proxied a websocket into another websocket with socket.io, if that's what you mean

[07:20] giby: it's done over http, but it's not widely supported

[07:20] btipling: node has won

[07:20] qFox has joined the channel
[07:21] giby: no way
[07:21] btipling: I'll never use lamp again
[07:21] btipling: at least
[07:21] giby: it is still far easier to get up and running with lamp than node
[07:21] giby: not saying anything about the quality of each, though
[07:21] btipling: node is just missing decent orm
[07:21] xSmurf has joined the channel
[07:21] btipling: then it's just game over
[07:22] tmpvar: wow
[07:22] giby: it's missing support by budget webhosts

[07:22] MooGoo: nodejs is gonna take over?

[07:23] tbranyen: then it'll be done
[07:23] chapel: lmao
[07:23] giby: i can edit a php file and have the changes take effect without restarting the websever (when running mod_php/php through cgi in apache)
[07:23] giby: I can't do that with node can I?
[07:23] chapel: ACTION kills whoever recommends mysql support in its core
[07:23] tbranyen: chapel: you laugh now, but mysql is making a come back!
[07:23] MooGoo: not without a lot of  boilet plate
[07:23] MooGoo: boiler
[07:23] btipling: doubt it
[07:23] MooGoo: node is apache tho
[07:24] MooGoo: it does double duty
[07:24] tmpvar: SocketHandler, ftw
[07:24] giby: 'is apache'?
[07:24] tbranyen: couchdb and mongo are already being phased out since they can't scale
[07:24] tbranyen: mysql has scaled since the dawn of time
[07:24] btipling: really?
[07:24] MooGoo: it is the webserver
[07:24] btipling: I'm using redis
[07:24] btipling: redis cluster is coming out soon
[07:24] MooGoo: as well as the script runner
[07:24] btipling: should scale then
[07:24] tbranyen: btipling: can't scale :-/
[07:24] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[07:24] btipling: lies
[07:24] giby: ah right, but that means you have to restart it all the time!
[07:24] chapel: don't listen to tbranyen, he is just fucking with you
[07:24] btipling: once redis cluster is out it can
[07:24] tbranyen: chapel: he was fucking with me first
[07:25] btipling: and there's a thrift interface for node
[07:25] btipling: so you can use cassandra
[07:25] giby: I think it's incredibly valuable to be able to develop in php and keep the server running the whole time
[07:25] btipling: with node
[07:25] chapel: giby: there are dev tools that restart your node server on file changes
[07:25] tmpvar: giby, that is because php operates in completely different fashion
[07:25] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[07:25] chapel: like restartr
[07:26] chapel: `v git restartr
[07:26] v8bot: chapel: aaronblohowiak/restartr - GitHub - https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/restartr
[07:26] giby: which is fine, unless your server takes 2 minutes to start up :(
[07:26] tbranyen: get a faster computer
[07:26] giby: tmpvar: I know, I'm just saying it's a nice advantage
[07:26] btipling: at least
[07:26] btipling: 256mb server
[07:26] tmpvar: giby, in php web land, a request comes into apache, it spawns off a worker.. starts up php, parses your php  and emits the results
[07:26] chapel: its a disadvantage
[07:26] tmpvar: giby, that is slow ;)
[07:26] btipling: you can use fastcgi too avoid that can't you
[07:26] giby: it is slow for the user, not for the developer
[07:26] niftylettuce: you could modify php with connect middlewarez
[07:26] giby: woh's side are you on!
[07:27] tmpvar: node has the ability to go from 0 to 5k in 0
[07:27] tmpvar: well.. milliseconds
[07:27] niftylettuce: 0  to 10 k **
[07:27] niftylettuce: tmpvar++
[07:27] v8bot:  niftylettuce has given a beer to tmpvar. tmpvar now has 1 beers.
[07:27] saschagehlich: anyone going to euruko tonight?
[07:27] tmpvar: so restarting it isnt a problem
[07:27] tbranyen: giby: maybe you should rethink what you're doing on start that is making it so slow
[07:27] giby: 0-5k?
[07:27] tmpvar: its fast enough to restart between requests
[07:27] tbranyen: maybe you can defer a lot of that
[07:27] tmpvar: i say 5 conservatively
[07:28] btipling: that's amazing
[07:28] tbranyen: do you believe in magic?
[07:28] btipling: I like node.js and I like go because go syntax is fun
[07:28] giby: it's not slow for me now, but I don't have a significant node server - I am just expecint it to be slow
[07:29] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:29] giby: since I have worked on large server binaries that take foreever to start
[07:29] pifantastic has joined the channel
[07:29] tmpvar: giby, this is not java + liferay + struts
[07:29] tbranyen: giby: well node defers heavily on I/O heavy tasks, if all you have is stuff in memory it'll be fast as shit
[07:29] tmpvar: not even apache + php ;)
[07:29] btipling: java + apache + tomkat + gwt
[07:29] tmpvar: btipling, haha.. another hater.. I love it
[07:29] btipling: :D
[07:30] chapel: lol
[07:30] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[07:30] giby: so do you normally find that significant node servers start up in less than a second?
[07:30] tmpvar: giby, yes
[07:30] giby: cool
[07:30] chapel: giby: node servers are super fast, unless it is dependent on an external service that is slow
[07:30] tmpvar: normally < 100ms
[07:30] btipling: you can lazy load stuff too can't you
[07:31] madzak: what would people recommend when needing multiple callbacks to fire in parallel and have a return when all callbacks have finished? right now i'm using a counter but wondered if one of the libraries out there are better
[07:31] tmpvar: right, depends on how much you do on startup
[07:31] gozala has joined the channel
[07:31] tbranyen: i used to do a lot of asp.net dev
[07:31] tbranyen: restarting those servers
[07:31] tbranyen: god damn
[07:31] madzak: tbranyen: i feel sorry for you
[07:31] tbranyen: take a coffee break like 20 times a day
[07:31] btipling: madzak: asynchronous callbacks?
[07:31] madzak: btipling: yes
[07:31] giby: what if I make a change in some core dependency that causes it to recompile everything
[07:31] tmpvar: madzak, depends on how many times you are going to do that.. 
[07:31] btipling: a counter works
[07:32] tmpvar: yep
[07:32] btipling: track it with an array etc
[07:32] giby: does it recompile js on startup? afaik v8 does compile the js to bytecode when it first reads it right?
[07:32] chapel: giby: recompile what?
[07:32] chapel: lol
[07:32] madzak: tmpvar, btipling: cool i'll keep the counter thanks
[07:32] chapel: you aren't gonna notice
[07:32] tmpvar: giby, thats basically un-noticable
[07:32] newy has joined the channel
[07:32] giby: the time it would take to compile ~100k lines of js is unnoticable?
[07:32] tmpvar: chapel,  lol.. you've got it.. im over here making up words
[07:33] chapel: tmpvar: :)
[07:33] jetienne has joined the channel
[07:33] chapel: giby: are you going to do 100k lines of js?
[07:33] tmpvar: giby, i suggest you just try it ;)
[07:33] chapel: how many loc is socket.io?
[07:33] tmpvar: socket.io isnt that big
[07:33] chapel: hmm
[07:33] chapel: yeah, node makes that nice
[07:33] giby: chapel: it seems reasonable that I would
[07:34] btipling: half my lines are jsdoc comments
[07:34] giby: tmpvar: I would like to know before writing so much code :)
[07:34] btipling: do those count?
[07:34] tmpvar: giby, restarts are fast
[07:34] chapel: uhh, giby if you have a noticeable startup time, then you are doing something wrong
[07:34] tmpvar: much faster than you'd expect elsewhere
[07:34] tmpvar: but, it depends on what you are doing on startup
[07:34] btipling: maybe he's doing some network i/o
[07:34] tmpvar: if you decide to go to the moon, its going to take a while
[07:34] supster: madzak: if you're doing it a lot you might want to look at something like https://github.com/caolan/async
[07:34] chapel: if you are just loading js and thats it
[07:34] jetienne: what is the good way to do controller in express.js
[07:34] chapel: then it should be near instant
[07:34] giby: assume I'm not blocking on any network I/O on startup
[07:35] chapel: v8 is fast
[07:35] giby: how fast though
[07:35] tmpvar: giby, try it
[07:35] tbranyen: giby: you trolling?
[07:35] chapel: faster than apache
[07:35] btipling: ebs on ec2 can get slow too
[07:35] MooGoo: warp 9
[07:35] chapel: seems like he is
[07:35] tbranyen: how the hell do we know how fast something takes to load up on your hardware
[07:35] MooGoo: you need to write in C if you want warp 10
[07:35] tmpvar: lol
[07:36] tmpvar: asm
[07:36] btipling: are warp levels exponential?
[07:36] madzak: supster: what would you a lot is? i would say average will spin up about 8 async callbacks
[07:36] MooGoo: nah
[07:36] MooGoo: warp 10 is Infinite speed
[07:36] giby: I can't just 'try' compiling tens of thousands of lines of javascript
[07:36] MooGoo: so it's....
[07:37] tmpvar: you wont need tens of thousands of lines
[07:37] tmpvar: ^)^
[07:37] chapel: giby: you aren't compiling anything
[07:37] MooGoo: is it logrithmic?
[07:37] jetienne: you are looping guys
[07:37] chapel: madzak: check out http://caolan.github.com/nimble/
[07:38] supster: madzak: i'd say if you get annoyed of writing your counting code or need to make use of the other use cases the library provides (e.g., performing in series)
[07:38] giby: chapel: why not?
[07:38] chapel: giby: ... why not not?
[07:38] jetienne: giby: what do you wanna know. can you reask the original question
[07:39] giby: jetienne: I am curious what a realistic startup time is for projects with tens of thousands of line of javascript. afaik v8 compiles js into bytecode before it runs, so it seems like it would take some time to recompile all the js during startup
[07:39] snearch has joined the channel
[07:40] giby: but I don't if that time is 10ms, 10 seconds, or 5 minutes
[07:40] tmpvar: < 10 seconds
[07:40] jetienne: giby: it is compiler to asm directly there are no bytecode
[07:40] tmpvar: let me prove it
[07:40] jetienne: giby: you should bench it
[07:40] giby: i would but I don't have the js codebase to do so yet
[07:40] jetienne: giby: find a large app and launch it
[07:41] jetienne: giby: so try to find it
[07:41] jetienne: what is the largest app runnable in npm ?
[07:41] jetienne: something with a lots of dependancy
[07:41] giby: no idea, and not sure how to find it
[07:41] febits has joined the channel
[07:41] jetienne: giby: maybe somebody here got suggestion
[07:42] jetienne: something which depends on express and more
[07:42] jetienne: giby: you need a bench, not a guess from people on irc
[07:43] tmpvar: giby, i have two links for ya
[07:43] giby: what are they? :)
[07:43] tmpvar: 1) the test suite for jsdom level2/html : https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/test/level2/html.js (19k lines)
[07:43] tmpvar: 2) the time it takes to process the file: https://gist.github.com/996698
[07:44] tmpvar: its ~300ms if I dont echo it out
[07:44] jetienne: yep echo got a big cost
[07:44] giby: awesome, thanks
[07:44] jetienne: if you relaunch several time with out echo, what is the last timing
[07:45] giby: does it cache the previous compilations? does it do incremental compiles with that cache?
[07:45] jetienne: giby: you come from php no ? :)
[07:45] tmpvar: jetienne, https://gist.github.com/996698#file_gistfile2.txt
[07:46] giby: well I have done php but I come from python and java servers more
[07:46] jetienne: giby: no idea if js is cached. this is likely happening like it happens in chrome
[07:46] tmpvar: so ~ 250ms?
[07:46] tmpvar: rough count.. which is not bad
[07:46] jetienne: giby: node server are not relaunch at each request. parsing it is negigibal
[07:46] jetienne: negligable
[07:46] tmpvar: happens once
[07:46] qrux: This is an interesting question y'all are trying to find the answer toâ¦But what was the original question?  Whether node starts faster (given a bunch of JS deps) than a2 + phpâ¦?
[07:46] cjm_ has joined the channel
[07:47] tmpvar: qrux, a2 is slow to start, and slow to serve
[07:47] jetienne: qrux: start on boot ? 
[07:47] chapel: well, not faster that apache
[07:47] giby: my interest is in the debug/edit cycle, not so much the serve performance
[07:47] chapel: more just about large projects
[07:47] msucan has joined the channel
[07:47] giby: i know nodejs is very fast in serveing performance :)
[07:47] chapel: giby: is fast :)
[07:47] jetienne: giby: negligable
[07:48] qrux: Okay.  The dev cycle.  Thank you.
[07:48] jetienne: giby: man test, you are asking the same question over an dover
[07:48] chapel: and jetienne dont think its v8 caching, probably the os caching the files in memory or something
[07:48] tbranyen: jetienne: yeah but we haven't gotten any closer to figure out if its fast or not
[07:48] giby: jetienne: I am just repeating the question when someone asks!

[10:52] mscdex: ah ok, then check ~/local/node/bin/node
[10:54] doomhz: it's there
[10:54] mscdex: ok
[10:54] doomhz: let me see if I close the console
[10:54] doomhz: yes, still there
[10:55] doomhz: but node is not working anymore :)
[10:55] x4rMa has joined the channel
[10:55] mscdex: i'd edit your ~/.bashrc and add that directory (/home/doomhz/local/node/bin) to your $PATH
[10:55] doomhz: so if I do a fresh install in a console - it's working - after closing the console - not anymore
[10:55] doomhz: ok
[10:55] doomhz: let me try
[10:55] mscdex: like: export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH
[10:55] [[zz]] has joined the channel

[11:17] doomhz: btw, is https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate great?
[11:17] doomhz: do you recommend it for starting a new project?
[11:17] tuhoojabotti: I recommend notepad
[11:18] tuhoojabotti: vim/nano is also cool.
[11:19] Bonuspunkt: nobody recomment cloud9
[11:19] Bonuspunkt: ?
[11:19] doomhz: hm, node-boilerplate is like an Expree+Socket.IO+HTML boilerplate in it
[11:19] mscdex: i've never used boilerplate
[11:20] doomhz: mscdex: do you use Express?
[11:23] cystbear:  guys how to install nodejs at ubuntu, what I should do after installation?
[11:24] torgeir has joined the channel
[11:25] cystbear: looks like, nodejs is installed, but I can not understand what I should to do next
[11:25] aliem: cystbear: you could install npm and begin to peke around with node ...
[11:25] aliem: *poke
[11:25] cystbear: npm installed too, but I can not understand how RUN something
[11:25] cystbear: for example express
[11:26] tuhoojabotti: Wohoo
[11:26] tuhoojabotti: it works
[11:26] tuhoojabotti: my first mysql production :P
[11:27] cystbear: AND main question is, should express be located at native node directory? or not ?
[11:27] aliem: the latest npm installs it's libs inside the cwd in node-modules unless you use the -g flag (it will install the modules inside the global namespace)
[11:28] aliem: once you install express you can use it's generators to create a new app
[11:28] AntelopeSalad: if you use the -g flag can you still require modules in their node-native way? (ex. require('foo'))?
[11:28] mscdex: doomhz: i haven't had a chance to use it yet
[11:28] Bradleymeck has joined the channel
[11:28] mscdex: doomhz: i've been doing mostly non-web stuff
[11:29] doomhz: ah, ok, thanks
[11:29] mscdex: i think npm's -g is only for modules that install command-line utilities
[11:30] fangel_ has joined the channel
[11:31] AntelopeSalad: i ask because i just setup a dev env. with ubuntu and it seems like i can longer require('some_npm_installed_module')
[11:31] AntelopeSalad: *no longer
[11:32] x4rMa: is it oke if node_modules installed outside node directory ?
[11:32] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: yep, that's the idea
[11:33] Wa has joined the channel
[11:33] AntelopeSalad: slaskis: it's really strange though
[11:34] AntelopeSalad: example: my friend and i both have npm 1.0.6 and node 0.4.8 , both of us npm installed our modules globally , he can require them normally but i cannot
[11:34] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: maybe your NODE_PATH is set to something else? 
[11:35] slaskis: try writing `require.paths` in the  node repl
[11:36] AntelopeSalad: ./home/nick/.node_modules|node_libraries , /usr/local/lib/node
[11:36] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[11:36] slaskis: is there a . in the beginning?
[11:36] AntelopeSalad: yes
[11:36] slaskis: ./home ?
[11:36] slaskis: that might be it
[11:36] AntelopeSalad: no, i just did that because you can't send a / as the first char over irc
[11:36] slaskis: oh, ok
[11:37] AntelopeSalad: i do not have a .node_modules directory in my home dir though, instead it's .npm
[11:37] jacter has joined the channel
[11:37] slaskis: i think npm 1.0 installs it in the /usr/local/lib/node folder by default...
[11:38] slaskis: is your modules in there?
[11:38] asabil has joined the channel
[11:38] AntelopeSalad: that directory is empty except for a wafadmin folder
[11:39] slaskis: try a `npm list -g` 
[11:39] tmpvar has joined the channel
[11:39] slaskis: it should tell you which are installed and where..
[11:39] AntelopeSalad: ok, they are back 1 directory
[11:40] AntelopeSalad: they are in /usr/local/lib/node_modules
[11:40] slaskis: hmm yeah, mine is installed in /usr/local/lib/node_modules too
[11:40] AntelopeSalad: but they are also in ~/.npm
[11:41] slaskis: and it can't find global ones either
[11:41] slaskis: so that's probably why :P
[11:42] TomY has joined the channel
[11:42] AntelopeSalad: so we need to add that path to node's paths?
[11:42] cystbear: guys should express framework  be located at native node directory? or not ?
[11:43] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: as a test, start your node with this: NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules node
[11:43] slaskis: works for me, i can require("npm") after that
[11:44] AntelopeSalad: yep, me too
[11:44] Charuru: hi guys
[11:45] Charuru: how do you turn off websockets for chrome in socket.io?
[11:45] Charuru: i remember eden telling me but i forgot :S
[11:45] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: so you can set that in your .bashrc (or whatever you use) and it should work every time
[11:45] AntelopeSalad: i wonder if we can do this too http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/path.html
[11:46] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[11:46] mscdex: old docs :O
[11:47] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: this one describes how it finds the modules: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/modules.html
[11:47] AntelopeSalad: oops yeah, first google result heh
[11:47] AntelopeSalad: i'm kind of curious, do you have an .npm folder in your home dir too? it contains the modules and an npm folder inside
[11:48] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: yep i do
[11:48] slaskis: i think that's the cache
[11:49] AntelopeSalad: ah
[11:50] slaskis: AntelopeSalad: yep: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/cache.md
[11:51] mscdex: Charuru: i don't think there is a setting or command-line flag for that, but you could do something like "WebSocket = undefined;" before any other js code
[11:53] AntelopeSalad: i'm still kind of retarded with linux, adding that to the .bashrc doesn't seem to work
[11:53] frodenius has joined the channel
[11:53] frodenius has joined the channel
[11:54] Charuru: mscdex: thanks that disabled websocket, but chrome makes no attempt to my fallback xhr polling
[11:55] tmpvar: Charuru, there is a way to specify allowed transports
[11:55] tmpvar: umm..
[11:55] mscdex: Charuru: are you sure it's not trying to use flash sockets?
[11:56] Charuru: transports: ['xhr-polling']
[11:56] Charuru: transports look like this
[11:56] adambeynon has joined the channel
[11:56] Charuru: tmpvar: yeah i remember eden telling me about some config
[11:56] tmpvar: should force xhr polling
[11:56] Charuru: it's on websockets unless i disable it with undefined
[11:57] Charuru: at which point it doesn't try to connect at all
[11:57] tmpvar: ok
[11:57] chapel: hmm
[11:57] tmpvar: so when you do a io.listen()
[11:57] Yoric has joined the channel
[11:57] chapel: can anyone test installing stylus with npm?
[11:57] Yoric has left the channel
[11:58] tmpvar: io.listen(server, { transports : ['xhr-polling'] })
[11:58] tmpvar: is that what you are doing?
[11:58] tmpvar: Charuru ^^
[11:58] Charuru: nope, but i should i think :P
[11:58] Charuru: will do that
[11:58] tmpvar: yep
[11:58] tmpvar: you should ;)
[11:58] tmpvar: let us know
[12:00] Charuru: tmpvar: no go chrome doesn't try to connect with xhr-polling
[12:00] Charuru: firefox works though
[12:02] tmpvar: Charuru, you can also pass a transports config on the client: https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io
[12:02] tmpvar: read and weap or some such
[12:03] Charuru: yeah i've been doing that
[12:03] tmpvar: it might be time to gist 
[12:03] tmpvar: although, that should work
[12:03] Charuru: was only setting the transport in the client, then you told me to do the set the server, so I did
[12:03] tmpvar: and just a side conversation, why would you disable websockets?
[12:03] Charuru: it's not working for certain countries
[12:04] Charuru: I can't understand, but I've been trying to test
[12:04] tmpvar: hrm
[12:04] tmpvar: it's supposed to fall back
[12:04] Charuru: i see in my logs they're trying to connect with websocket
[12:04] Charuru: but they never do
[12:04] tmpvar: weird

[12:20] razvandimescu: how can i get the request parameters when using express?
[12:21] zeunix: any ideas on cpu core affinity for node child processes? specifically, regardless of why, best practice for keeping the child processes off the core the parent is on?
[12:22] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[12:22] tmpvar: zeunix, not sure that makes sense as stated
[12:22] tmpvar: but i think i know what you are getting at
[12:23] zeunix: so for example if you have four cores and 1 parent + 6 child processes, if the 6 children processes share three cores, maybe even maxing them out, but regardless they can never touch the core the parent is on
[12:23] tmpvar: and i think the general answer is: it depends on how much work your main process is doing
[12:23] zeunix: only the parent process has the ability to max that core out
[12:24] mscdex: there can be only one!
[12:24] tmpvar: zeunix, you'd have to rig that with your os
[12:24] tmpvar: which means you'd need a deep understand of what is going on
[12:25] tmpvar: right now, spawning child processes from node are _not_ locked to a core
[12:25] zeunix: tmpvar: something like sched_setaffinity in Linux bound in a node addon?
[12:25] neoesque has joined the channel
[12:25] tmpvar: zeunix, not that I've seen
[12:26] tmpvar: but I dont know everything ;)
[12:26] zeunix: tmpvar: oh I was referring to: http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setaffinity
[12:26] tmpvar: oh, i missunderstood.. that would be interesting
[12:26] jtsnow has joined the channel
[12:27] tmpvar: but i have not seen it done as of yet
[12:27] zeunix: tmpvar: the point would be that if the children are misbehaving or on a runway spree the parent can easily shut them down or get stats on them without delay
[12:28] zeunix: otherwise, if all 6 children can get access to any cores, the parent is at the mercy of getting it's time in
[12:28] zeunix: I realize, not always the most efficient use of resources ;)
[12:28] tmpvar: heh
[12:28] tmpvar: I wouldn't really worry about the parent "not getting through" unless you are completely saturating the machine
[12:29] zeunix: that's the point though, that in this case, it's very likely the machine will be completely maxed out at any given time
[12:29] tmpvar: if that is your intention, then yes. core affinities is a good choice lol

[12:30] tmpvar: zeunix, it is *always* a possibility

[12:31] synkro has joined the channel
[12:31] zeunix: tmpvar: setting the a controller process on a different box all together is the BEST choice, but I'm looking for flexibility in a single box environment 
[12:31] tmpvar: you'll probably want to write an addon in that case
[12:32] tmpvar: i havent seen anything that does this
[12:32] zeunix: tmpvar: agreed, just curious if anyone had thought about this prior and had some genius ideas on a cross-platform solution. :)
[12:33] zeunix: I'll ask ryan monday on his thoughts.
[12:33] tmpvar: cool
[12:33] zeunix: he's pretty good at poking holes in most of the bs that spews from my mouth
[12:33] tmpvar: heh

[12:38] mscdex: that means it's time to go to sleep
[12:38] tmpvar: mscdex, we roll hard.
[12:39] tmpvar: mscdex, thats a bad idea..
[12:39] zeunix: mscdex: totally. I'm thinking about sleep myself.
[12:39] mscdex: been working on this pandaboard all night

[12:40] zeunix: I have to go round the horn when I get inverted

[12:42] mscdex: no, i've never had to really worry about that yet

[12:44] tmpvar: oh shit..

[12:58] tuhoojabotti: of current position
[12:58] tuhoojabotti: like index
[12:58] tmpvar: zeunix, what are you doing?
[12:59] zeunix: ah snap, gotta have root privileges to set the niceness to anything lower so obviously exec isn't gonna work.
[12:59] tuhoojabotti: it's like .page_title.index, but I need .page_title."index"
[12:59] mscdex: tuhoojabotti: that should work just fine: var cur_pos = 'index'; console.log(obj.page_title[cur_pos]);

[13:29] cystbear: so, should I try install express without sudo, under regular user?
[13:29] cystbear: or just add "-g" flag?
[13:30] opennix has left the channel
[13:30] guybrush: the -g tells npm to install the package into the global prefix
[13:30] tmpvar: cystbear, try npm install -g express
[13:30] opennix has joined the channel
[13:30] tmpvar: if it doesnt work, then use sudo
[13:30] cystbear: doing...

[13:31] cystbear: *hooray
[13:31] cystbear: -> # express --version
[13:31] cystbear: 2.3.10
[13:31] tmpvar: yay for winning
[13:32] cystbear: could you please hint me a bit closer what does mean  "-g" flag, what is global ?
[13:32] zeunix: jetienne: weird. In top, it shows the correct user, but in Activity Monitor on a Mac, it does not. I'll have to test to see if it's actually just an Apple AM bug or node. Most likely Apple's bad it seems.  I'll file a bug report if it turns up the former. Thanks!
[13:32] cystbear: @tmpvar could you please hint me a bit closer what does mean  "-g" flag, what is global ?
[13:33] broofa has joined the channel
[13:33] tmpvar: cystbear, it means it will install the package globally
[13:33] zeunix: cystbear: here's a good explanation: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/
[13:33] tmpvar: in my case, I have node installed in ~/local/bin
[13:33] tmpvar: yes, zeunix 
[13:33] tmpvar: nice
[13:34] tmpvar: zeunix, so, i've seen this setgid issue before
[13:34] tmpvar: i started looking around then got sidetracked with some nodeunit tests im supposed to be writing
[13:34] zeunix: tmpvar: is it really not changing the user or just an Apple bug?
[13:35] edude03 has joined the channel
[13:35] tmpvar: i dont think its an apple bug
[13:35] cystbear: thanks, guys, you are welcome to #symfony-dev channel  at freenode IRC server
[13:35] zeunix: tmpvar: cause if I just change the user at parse time, apple's Activity Monitor goes from root to 501, but if I delay it in a setTimeout or whatever it doesn't change. BUT I got curious, and in top it DOES register the change
[13:35] tmpvar: weird
[13:36] tmpvar: cystbear, php? :(
[13:36] tmpvar: tears
[13:36] zeunix: hahaha I was thinking the same thing
[13:36] zeunix: I'm a dayjob php'er
[13:36] zeunix: so badly looking for a node full time gig but it's a little early

[13:44] Bj_o_rn has joined the channel
[13:44] cystbear: how can know? I am very young developer only 1,5 years of experience, few days ago was at JS master classes and now want learn node
[13:45] zeunix: I actually personally (that's the key) like PHP. I like Javascript better, but prior to node/rhino being around, for me it's either PHP or Java and I ain't jumping through the Java hoops for just any website.
[13:45] coreb has joined the channel
[13:46] cystbear: @zeunix, I got your position
[13:46] zeunix: node is very young and there aren't a ton of jobs open for it (I know, I'm looking) so most of us just do it for a hobby or at a job where our primary gig is in another platform.
[13:46] markwubben has joined the channel
[13:47] zeunix: cystbear: what I mean is, I wouldn't put all your eggs into the node basket JUST yet. Learn it, hell yes please do. But it shouldn't be your one and only.
[13:47] maushu has joined the channel
[13:47] zeunix: anyone and everyone gripes about one language or another, but the facts remain that the ability to whip up a mean PHP is in high demand in most development circles.
[13:48] cystbear: yes, you are right, just let me repeat old good thing: "if you good, you are good in all sides"
[13:48] zeunix: cystbear: not sure what you mean, cause that's sort of what I was implying :p
[13:48] tmpvar: java + security clearance 
[13:48] cystbear: @zeunix we are learn NOT languages, we learn approaches
[13:48] tmpvar: if you want money that is
[13:49] tmpvar: otherwise, you play the internet lottery
[13:49] tmpvar: ;)
[13:49] zeunix: tmpvar: second that, if you can get into it, and you're not a complete retard  you're golden.
[13:49] tmpvar: haha, read your gang of fours
[13:49] tmpvar: tarded be gone
[13:50] zeunix: I'm constantly surprised at the number of people in our field that just don't like programming.
[13:51] zeunix: the 9-5ers

[13:52] zeunix: lame

[14:21] tuhoojabotti: :o
[14:21] tuhoojabotti: screenshot pl0x
[14:21] zeunix: in Safari, the h2 "Welcome to the land.." starts from invisible small and scales to large, BUT the font isn't rendered as sans-serif until it's done
[14:21] tuhoojabotti: zeunix: also can you test if my main page works with safari, I think it had some problem, if you have error console, please pastebin (I didn't manage to get it)
[14:21] rfay has joined the channel
[14:22] tuhoojabotti: lol :D

[14:22] tuhoojabotti: Does it work?
[14:22] tuhoojabotti: cliking the links etc?
[14:22] tuhoojabotti: "links" :P
[14:22] zeunix: the transition only happens with JS disabled
[14:23] tuhoojabotti: huh
[14:23] tuhoojabotti: I wonder what that is
[14:23] tuhoojabotti: Are you sure you're talking about dev site now?

[15:48] dhasenan: apejens, there's a hell of a lot of C++ in node-gitteh. It's probably the source of your troubles -- probably a stray 'exit()' in an exception handler.

[16:50] cpolis has joined the channel
[16:50] jslatts: lukstr: yes and no actually. you were dead on with the threading issue. I implemented the libev notification and got it working....
[16:50] sveimac has joined the channel
[16:51] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[16:51] jslatts: lukstr: however, it works in a crappy way. I have to block the executation of the main thread in order to make the external library happy because it uses a Qt event loop
[16:51] jslatts: lukstr: so essentially, I can run the external lib as a module, but it blocks node until it finishes its crunching.
[16:52] lukstr: jslatts: hmm there _should_ be away to get around that with libev...
[16:52] lukstr: what call is blocking?
[16:52] jslatts: lukstr: well, the problem is that QtCoreApplication refuses to start outside of main(), so I can't stick it in a pthread
[16:52] lukstr: bahah
[16:52] jslatts: lukstr: and if I start it up inside of main(), it takes over and block
[16:52] jslatts: s
[16:52] jslatts: it sucks. I hate qt right now
[16:53] lukstr: are you integrating v8 into a Qt app?
[16:53] lukstr: how is node involved?
[16:53] jslatts: lukstr: so, we have this vendor who gave us this implementation of a multi-threaded algorithm. we want to use it on a server instead of a workstation
[16:53] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[16:54] jslatts: lukstr: so I am trying to wrap it as a node module so we can throw it up on an EC2 or similar and let it crunch away
[16:54] jslatts: lukstr: but their implementation assumes a full Qt stack and I can't get at their source

[17:07] jslatts: yes, handles the checkout process, feeds the data back to a central server
[17:08] Aria: Actually PoS systems are a real need. Web-and-hardware-based, both. More and more businesses are integrating a web presence, and the software that exists for it is abominable.
[17:08] Aria: If there were two of me, one of me would be writing such a beast.
[17:08] jasonmcleod has joined the channel
[17:08] Aria: Lots of fine points that make it a hard task, though the core code doesn't have to be that complex.
[17:08] Aria: Lots of user interface issues.
[17:08] jslatts: yep. the "hard" part about that is making it useful across a lot of different business types
[17:09] jslatts: maybe pick a niche (pet stores) and optimize to them first

[17:10] andihit: but would you program such a large project in JS?
[17:10] sechrist has joined the channel
[17:10] Aria: And then, for a PoS, there's also an uptime problem: Crashing mid sale -- hardware included -- needs a fallback plan simple enough for only partially-trusted employees to use.
[17:10] jslatts: andihit: you _could_ :)
[17:10] Aria: andihit: I'd certainly not do it in a less flexible language!
[17:10] madzak: ^ agreed
[17:10] Aria: And speed is NOT a concern. Unless you totally fuck up algorithms, it'll be fast enough.
[17:11] jslatts: maybe a bit large of a problem for a single dev
[17:11] Aria: Orders are never 10,000 items. A day's sales, even in a big grocery, aren't even that big.
[17:11] andihit: I like python for that stuff. but then it would has nothing to do with node.js, does it? or maybe some core with python (REST webservice) and node.js/express as front-end
[17:11] Aria: I could, in a year, probably put together such a package. Working 40 hour weeks.
[17:11] madzak: Aria: could be if you setup partners who batch post orders at the end of the month
[17:11] Aria: andihit: I'd use node myself, but any language is possible.
[17:11] Aria: madzak: Okay, there's that. Though why you'd wait 'til month-end is beyond me. The world of business needs to get AWAY from batching. 
[17:12] andihit: my problem isn't node, it's the OOP of JS ;)
[17:12] madzak: Aria: agree'd ;)
[17:12] Aria: This isn't 1972 anymore.
[17:12] jslatts: andihit: go watch crockford and be enlightened
[17:12] jslatts: its plenty OOP
[17:12] Aria: andihit: Turns out that OOP is only one technique, and not always the best one ;-)
[17:12] madzak: we need to make realtime a buzzword
[17:12] jslatts: RT
[17:12] jslatts: oh.. is your software RT 2.0?

[17:14] mikeal: how do we add dtrace probes to our own code
[17:15] mikeal: the calls that are in core/lib don't work
[17:15] Aria: It's interesting: I'm ripping the OOP out of some code I wrote right now. It's the wrong technique. Turns out what I wanted was a router for data -- not tying my code to the data structures like classic OOP.
[17:15] Aria: So what I end up with now is much more functional, half the size, with a quarter the boilerplate code.
[17:15] Aria: And it feels like Javascript. The data objects are serializable as JSON. 
[17:16] andihit: jslatts: what exactly? JavaScript: The Good Parts? ;)
[17:16] Aria: And inheritance is often overrated -- how often do you design a deep heirarchy and put it to good use?
[17:16] madzak: Aria: do you find you rip out all the OOP or leave "the good parts"
[17:16] jslatts: andihit: the YUI theater videoshttp://javascript.crockford.com/
[17:16] jslatts: http://javascript.crockford.com/
[17:17] andihit: jslatts: thx
[17:17] Aria: madzak: Leave some where it's a good technique. Definitely rip out all the classical inheritance, in this case. It's rarely what you want.
[17:17] Aria: Lots more wrappers, lots fewer inheritance trees.
[17:18] Aria: Decorators. Routers. Proxies.
[17:18] madzak: found that to be the case as well
[17:18] Aria: So yeah, if you're used to Python or Ruby or C++, you're gonna have to relearn the best shapes for things.
[17:19] jslatts: can libev work across processes?
[17:20] jslatts: oooh, it can
[17:20] jslatts: it is so hard to write multi-threaded C++ code when you don't know C++

[18:09] DelvarWorld: if I require a module and set a property on it, and then require that module somewhere else, is that property still set?
[18:10] adnam: DelvarWorld: depends on what you need by "on it"
[18:10] cjm_: @aria, sorry I'm not perfectly clear on how to read the headers, can you provide a little more context?
[18:10] cjm_: I'm using express
[18:11] adnam: DelvarWorld: in a module you can set properties on the exports object, require() returns that object, such as when doing require("sys").puts("foo")
[18:12] DelvarWorld: adnam: like var bob=modules.exports;  â¦. var a = require('bob'); a.foo = 'bar';  â¦   var b = require('bob');  b.foo ?
[18:12] Aria: req.headers['user-agent']

[18:13] adnam: DelvarWorld: right
[18:13] DelvarWorld: ok good
[18:13] cjm_: thanks aria

[19:54] tbranyen: long running and data crunching intensive is meant for something else
[19:54] lmatteis: tbranyen: but what about all node libs that need to do intensive cpu operations?

[19:56] eboyjr: tbranyen is known for doing things in javascript you shouldn't be doing ;)
[19:56] tbranyen: haha what
[19:56] eboyjr: like that encryption thing
[19:56] tbranyen: i have never done anything with encryption
[19:57] tbranyen: you're thinking of someone else :-p
[19:57] lmatteis: how's that even possible... i understand all the I/O is done asynchronosly.. by the operatying system while the node loop continuous it's javascript exectuion... but some sort of intensive operations need to be done at the js level i would imagine
[19:57] eboyjr: liar! haha
[19:57] tbranyen: eboyjr: check out my github, lemme know when you find anything that has to do with encryption
[19:57] `3rdEden: tbranyen: they just scale across multiple processes..
[19:57] ryah: lmatteis: turns out - people don't really do intensive cpu operations
[19:57] MooGoo: everything that runs in nodejs blocks
[19:58] eboyjr: tbranyen: Well you weren't making a library for github.. you were porting some as3
[19:58] MooGoo: I think any script that is worried about extensive blocking just spawns a child process
[19:58] tbranyen: eboyjr: now i def know you are thinking of someone else... i have never written as3
[19:58] tbranyen: take care not to confuse me again please
[19:59] ryah: lmatteis: CPUs are really fast - it's very rare that computation latency compares to I/O latency
[19:59] `3rdEden: The only CPU operation that I'm doing is sending messages to 100k connected sockets.. This does make your CPU sweat a bit :)
[19:59] lmatteis: ryah: well, we were talking of text search libraries for node
[19:59] ryah: lmatteis: and even if you do have a case like that - say image resizing -it can be dealt with by kicking it out of process
[19:59] MooGoo: queries on large databases can still be slow
[20:00] eboyjr: tbranyen: I can pull up some logs ;)
[20:00] tbranyen: eboyjr: pleae do
[20:00] tim_smart: ryah: Redis job queues <3
[20:00] eboyjr: kk
[20:00] tbranyen: i'm curious as to when i ever talked about something i have never used
[20:00] tim_smart: image_queue.write({ resize: xxx })
[20:00] lmatteis: ryah: and it seems like all the search operations are outsourced to other process in other environments (java), which is kind of ugly if i want to keep dependencies low.
[20:01] jasonmcleod has joined the channel
[20:01] ryah: lmatteis: out source it to another node processes
[20:01] lmatteis: ok then, this was my idea
[20:01] ryah: it'll block - but that doesn't matter - as long as its not in your server loop
[20:01] lmatteis: but people in here started saying that node wasn't meant for searching because it's single threaded... so i got confused
[20:01] Aria: Heh. People used to thinking in threads and not processes say that a lot.
[20:01] lmatteis: ryah: exactly.
[20:01] Aria: Ignore them.
[20:02] MooGoo: in node you just have to handle it manually
[20:02] ryah: the OS spent a lot of time perfecting preemptive threading. we should use that.
[20:02] lmatteis: ryah: so are there any search libs you know about?
[20:02] ryah: lmatteis: not that i know of
[20:02] tbranyen: Aria: ignore them? great advice
[20:02] MooGoo: what text are you searching
[20:02] lmatteis: what's preemtptive threading?
[20:02] MooGoo: how is the text stored
[20:02] `3rdEden: sphix isn't build in java.. it's build in c++ lmatteis
[20:02] MooGoo: preemptive multitasking?
[20:03] ryah: lmatteis: the ability of the system to interupt your job and schedule something else
[20:03] MooGoo: that's at a process level
[20:03] MooGoo: in the os
[20:03] MooGoo: and you can use exactly that kinda of multitasking in node
[20:03] ryah: e.g. "this image resizing is taking too long - let's run the server process now"
[20:04] MooGoo: but far as I know OS's can't prempt code within a single process
[20:04] tim_smart: I just checked it a initial revision of a web app, around 200k loc of dependencies. Yay for module authors.
[20:05] lmatteis: so, heap allocation (the server loop getting more requests) is lighter (less resources) than creating a new process itself for each request?

The new document may be serialized by the processor in standard XML syntax or in another format, such as HTML or plain text. XSLT is most often used to convert data between different XML schemas or to convert XML data into w

[22:17] DelvarWorld: if I have a module that you are supposed to instantiate, like new thing(), would I do module.exports = thing; funciton thing() { return this }; thing.prototype.foo = function() {} ?

[22:17] kkaefer: DelvarWorld: yes
[22:17] kkaefer: (you don't need to return this, it's implied when using new)

[22:41] pplante: sadly i miss mirc
[22:41] MooGoo: weechat
[22:41] pplante: mostly because i had a lot of custom scripts i wrote for it
[22:41] drudge: pplante: we make Linkinus
[22:41] pplante: linkinus has its issues
[22:41] pplante: i just dont like the ui
[22:42] MooGoo: why would anyone use GUI irc clients
[22:42] pplante: native tabs with shift+cmd+[ or ] to switch channels is one of my gripes with linkinus
[22:42] pplante: MooGoo: not sure why since i live in the terminal about 60% of my life as it is

[22:47] jslatts: pplante: i bought textual for $5 because i hated all the other mac clients
[22:48] pplante: jslatts: i bought linkinus once upon a time in one of those mac software bundles at macheist
[22:48] jslatts: pplante: don't like?
[22:48] pplante: its alright
[22:49] pplante: im going to give weechat a spin
[22:49] drudge: ACTION sulks
[22:49] MooGoo: just make sure to use it with screen/tmux
[22:50] MooGoo: fairly obvious
[22:50] pplante: drudge: its not you, its me ;)

[22:53] jslatts: child process -> qt event queue -> boost IPC -> back to javascript
[22:53] jslatts: gross
[22:54] pplante: jslatts: you should add an extra layer in there for good measure
[22:54] pplante: never can have enough layers
[22:54] jslatts: pplante: yes... maybe i can through a web service in
[22:55] pplante: jslatts: now you can work on making it webscale
[22:55] tim_smart: Basic controllers for express https://github.com/Tim-Smart/express-aid

[22:58] pplante: MooGoo: oh my god there are so many options, thanks for the recommendation
[22:58] MooGoo: im sure im not even close to taking advantage of all the crap there is
[22:59] MooGoo: you might want to get buffer.pl and beep.pl if you care about notifications
[22:59] MooGoo: and be sure to use it for IM with bitlbee
[22:59] MooGoo: BE SURE
[23:01] pplante: only issue with running it on a remote machine is lack of growl notifications
[23:02] Aria: .oO(Growl network notifications)
[23:02] MooGoo: im sure there's some crazy convoluted way
[23:02] MooGoo: yea
[23:03] pplante: yeah the network notifications would be possible
[23:03] pplante: but wiring that up with a dynamic local ip would be a pain

[23:08] radicality: Hello. Can someone tell me how to effectively put JS into jade templates ? If I use the 'script' tag, many times jade complains of indendation/spaces etc. How can I put the JS somewhere else, and then include it in the template, but so that jade won't care about it's indendation ?
[23:11] AvianFlu: you can use a script tag to include a js file, can't you?
[23:11] AvianFlu: just be like <script src="whatever.js" >

[23:14] radicality: another thing then. how can I access a variable from my javascript that was sent from the node server.
[23:14] radicality: in jade you just do 'h1= title', but can I gain access to title inside javascript ?

[23:21] warz: im trying to import the connect module, but am missing the mime module required by it. is this a native nodejs module or not?
[23:21] warz: im not using npm, im using git for module.
[23:22] pplante has joined the channel
[23:23] DelvarWorld: npm install connect
[23:23] DelvarWorld: that will auto-install all of its dependencies 
[23:23] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:24] warz: i realize that. im just a fan of managing my own git repos for modules. it has been awhile since i used nodejs/npm, but i recall manual module git repos were easier than npm.
[23:25] boaz has joined the channel
[23:25] DelvarWorld: npm 1.0 installs your dependencies relative to each project, it's the way to go now
[23:25] DelvarWorld: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/package.json
[23:26] DelvarWorld: but those are all the modules required by connect if you want to get them one at a time
[23:26] gmanika has joined the channel
[23:27] kkaefer: warz: npm 1.0 is vastly improved
[23:27] kkaefer: warz: it's a good idea to use it over git submodules

[23:56] AvianFlu: so put it in a try catch
[23:56] Swizec: it's inside a native module
