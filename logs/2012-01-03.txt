[00:15] chjj: dec: in your second snippet you destroy the read stream when the request closes
[00:15] chjj: dec: that will indeed break things
[00:15] chjj: i imagine you wanted to experiment by destroying it once the response was over with
[00:17] chjj: dec: try this: `file.pipe(res, { end: false }); file.on('close', function() { res.end(); file.destroy(); });`
[00:17] chjj: see if that has any effect
[00:17] kn0where has joined the channel
[00:18] barberdt has joined the channel
[00:18] dec: chjj: my assumption was that if the request was closed (abruptly), then the response would end and wouldn't be reading from file any longer, so I could close the file read stream.
[00:19] chjj: dec: the problem with that is the data has to be piped into the response, and the request will end before the data is finished being piped to the response
[00:19] chjj: so youre killing the file stream while its being piped to the response
[00:19] dec: yes, because the response is no longer valid/required... or am I thinking about this incorrectly?
[00:20] dec: can I not 'stop' the file stream being piped into the response?
[00:20] dec: that's essentially what I'm trying to do.

[00:20] chjj: you can, but that would just break the response

[00:20] chjj: and it gives you the exact error it should have given you: EBADF
[00:21] dec: chjj: the response is already void, because the request was aborted prematurely...

[00:24] dec: chjj: the underlying problem I'm trying to handle is that the HTTP connection is closed prematurely, so my app has received a request and started pipe()ing the file read stream to the HTTP response - but without a connection to send the HTTP response back to, it seems to just hang open and never close the FDs.
[00:24] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[00:25] dec: chjj: I have watched the FDs it has open - it keeps my file read stream open forever until it runs out of FDs (via ulimit, whatever that limit may be)...

[00:32] Leemp_offsite: Quick question.. what would be the best way to synchronously remove files/directories in a directory? I have a test, and i want to remove all files/directories in a specific directory.. a clean test environment, every run, so to say. rmdirSync() has the issue of throwing errors anytime it encounters an error, so i'd have to use a try on every rm command.. i'm thinking of using exec(
[00:32] dec: chjj: it's the read stream from the file

[00:33] chjj: dec: how long does it take them to close
[00:33] kerigan: i want it to select the 25 newest entrys, so I sort by timestamp and then they should be sorted by the amount of votes they have
[00:34] Leemp_offsite: perezd: haha, righto, i'm just weird. Plus, i'm learning JS/Node, so learning right ways to do things (which in the future, may apply outside of the test), is good practice imo :)
[00:34] kerigan: but the vote sorting kinda doesn't work
[00:34] perezd: sometimes the right thing is the thing that works
[00:34] spcshpopr8r has joined the channel
[00:34] dec: chjj: I'm waiting to find out... so far the app has run for ~5 minutes with 91 file handles open for the file read stream and none of them have closed...
[00:35] dec: chjj: that's the problem - the HTTP socket closes (aborted by the client, for example), so the HTTP response seems to not be sent and the pipe to the file read stream stays open forever...
[00:35] Leemp_offsite: perezd: Dunno, i avoid system calls for one. Bad habit, imo. "it works" often fails to work in the future with system calls.. then again, i'm used to developing for more platforms than node is really geared for, at the moment
[00:35] Leemp_offsite: perezd: Anyway, thanks :)
[00:35] perezd: yeah, for a test env I think its totally fine, personally.
[00:36] Leemp_offsite: perezd: I know, but again, i was just asking for learning purposes. In the future i may want to do things outside of this test env hehe
[00:36] mde: Leemp_offsite You might try looking at Jake for your test/build. It supports async task-execution.

[00:36] Squeese has joined the channel
[00:36] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:37] context: unless you are using pipe, which when it closes, anything using those variables should go out of scope and get cleaned up
[00:37] context: even then id think they'd go out of scope :x
[00:37] dec: context: I am using pipe, I figured it would be handled automatically but it doesn't seem to be. The testcase is here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/8692064
[00:38] Leemp_offsite: mde: Well i'm using nodeunit at the moment, which supports async just fine, async just tends to add clutter (read:additional code). I often use fooSync() calls when available, just to avoid clutter
[00:38] Leemp_offsite: mde: Any opinion of Jake vs Nodeunit?
[00:38] dec: context: I think that the HTTP Response object doesn't get cleaned up when the HTTP connection aborts.
[00:38] dec: context: and subsequently, the file pipe doesn't close.

[00:40] Leemp_offsite: mde: Ah hah :)

[11:04] kishoreyekkanti has joined the channel
[11:04] nicholasf: vdemedes: isnt that the same as what I had?
[11:04] vdemedes: nicholasf: much cleaner
[11:04] nicholasf: yes, I agree
[11:04] vdemedes: nicholasf: and isnt that what you wanted? to structure code?
[11:04] boehm has joined the channel
[11:04] vdemedes: nicholasf: if not, then I did not get your question
[11:04] nicholasf: vdemedes: sorry, I didnt explain it properly
[11:05] nicholasf: running this waterfall the console logs '1' and '2'
[11:05] nicholasf: but it doesn't log '3'
[11:05] vdemedes: nicholasf: it is not waterfall's problem
[11:05] vdemedes: this is your users.get method
[11:05] nicholasf: yes, but this is what I want to do in the waterfall
[11:06] nicholasf: do I need to embed a waterfall in a waterall?
[11:06] vdemedes: you need to test your users.get method
[11:06] nicholasf: ACTION nods
[11:06] vdemedes: look, you just asking me questions and I dont know what you want to do and what is this users.get doing
[11:06] vdemedes: I can't really help you because of lack of info
[11:06] vdemedes: and code
[11:06] nicholasf: ACTION nods
[11:06] kishoreyekkanti has joined the channel
[11:07] nicholasf: vdemedes: I want the (err, reply) callback to be placed in the waterfall
[11:07] nicholasf: as I need to ensure reply comes out of the waterfall
[11:08] vdemedes: hah, I dont even understand why do you need that waterfall
[11:08] vdemedes: do  you have an argument for htat?
[11:08] vdemedes: that
[11:08] shapeshed has joined the channel
[11:08] nicholasf: because I need to get the result of the users.get fbMetadata.uid call
[11:08] nicholasf: that is what must return from this method
[11:08] vdemedes: yeah, so why not just remove that waterfall?
[11:09] vdemedes: it does not have any benefit here
[11:09] nicholasf: the users = redback.createHash call is asynch
[11:09] tytsim has joined the channel
[11:10] vdemedes: if redback.createHash is async, then second function in waterfall will never receive correct users
[11:10] nicholasf: vdemedes: I thought that's what waterfall did. Do I need series, instead?
[11:11] vdemedes: look, if redback.createHash is async method, it must have an option for callback which will be fired when the operation is done
[11:11] vdemedes: and createHash method will send result to the callback you specified
[11:11] nicholasf: ACTION nods
[11:11] vdemedes: like: redback.createHash 'facebook_uids', (err, users) ->
[11:12] nicholasf: yes agreed

[11:21] medice: kanaran, what does "npm list" say
[11:21] vdemedes: nicholasf: mate, you are getting things wrong
[11:21] nicholasf: vdemedes: yup
[11:21] vdemedes: nicholasf: sec

[11:22] nicholasf: vdemedes: nope, Im stuck
[11:22] wedtm: I am having trouble searching for records in mongodb using the node-mongodb-native. Does anyone have any tips?
[11:22] medice: and is this the same directory you are executing node app.js or similar from
[11:22] wedtm: I do mongo.db.find({ _id : "4dd74af64e2e671446000030"}); but it always returns 0
[11:23] vdemedes: nicholasf: who said you that createHash() method is async?
[11:23] Kanaran: yes, same
[11:23] nicholasf: vdemedes: it isnt. That was my mistake
[11:23] projectskillz: wasup fellas
[11:23] nisc has joined the channel
[11:23] nicholasf: but the users.get call is obviously asynch
[11:23] medice: well, dont know then

[11:24] nisc: Hi. I like to use my node REPL with vim bindings. So I've tried rlwrap. All fine, but ofc the function/variable completion stops working. How to fix that?
[11:24] nicholasf: vdemedes: the return value from findFBUser is undefined 
[11:24] vdemedes: ofc
[11:25] vdemedes: findFBUser is sync method, while users.get is async
[11:25] vdemedes: sec
[11:25] nicholasf: vdemedes: this is why I am trying to learn async

[11:28] vdemedes: Kanaran: show the exact code of your app.js
[11:28] Kanaran: just: var io = require('socket.io').listen(5050);
[11:29] vdemedes: Kanaran:is there node_modules folder?
[11:29] Kanaran: the same line in a node console works fine.
[11:29] nicholasf: vdemedes: thanks, I'm still learning the basics here
[11:29] vdemedes: nicholasf: np, I understand ;-) was there :-D
[11:30] Kanaran: where do i have to search for the folder? (ubuntu 10.04)
[11:30] vdemedes: Kanaran: where your app.js is
[11:31] Kanaran: no
[11:31] vdemedes: Kanaran: then you did not install socket.io in the right folder

[12:21] vdemedes: wedtm: ?
[12:21] wedtm: deoxxa: oh? what's mineserver 2.0?
[12:21] wedtm: If it's interesting, I'll do a front page article on it.
[12:21] deoxxa: wedtm: c++ minecraft server - tons faster than the official software and better mod support
[12:21] deoxxa: it's far from finished though
[12:22] deoxxa: right now it's just basic dig/move/place blocks
[12:22] wedtm: For sure, email me at msmith@curse.com when it's finished and I'll give you a fron page article.
[12:22] booyaa: deoxxa: nice! you github'd?
[12:22] deoxxa: booyaa: yep - https://github.com/Mineserver/mineserver2
[12:23] deoxxa: been a bit slow lately, everyone's busy with holidays and such
[12:23] zomg: I like how you claimed it was tons faster and had better mod support
[12:23] zomg: but then it turned out it only had the very basics implemented
[12:23] zomg: :P
[12:23] booyaa: excellent will have a peek
[12:23] wedtm: zomg: I think it's probably PLANNED to be that way :)
[12:23] zomg: Probably
[12:23] zomg: =)
[12:23] deoxxa: zomg: well mineserver 1.0 was faster than the official server, and had better mod support - it became kind of unmaintainable though
[12:23] deoxxa: thus 2.0
[12:24] deoxxa: wedtm: i'll definitely take you up on that in the future! thanks!
[12:24] wedtm: Also, if you find any issues that could be implemented in the actual server, send those my way as well, I'll make sure they get to the right people at Mojang.

[16:45] eastc: but I guess it's valid since it's only serving static files
[16:45] pimperle: i added debug statements to the module in question and it seems, that the error reported by node debug vanishes, if node ist used without the debug option
[16:45] pimperle: however the app keeps crashing because of an error somewhere later, which i cannot find
[16:46] pimperle: as node debug causes it to fail even earlier

[21:52] voodootikigod__: that was my first thought, currently the latest version
[21:52] isaacs: "latest" = 1.1 or 1.0?
[21:52] voodootikigod__: 1.1
[21:53] voodootikigod__: beta

[21:53] langworthy_ has joined the channel
[21:53] isaacs: gotcha

[21:53] voodootikigod__: are you on ubuntu or have a ubuntu image?
[21:53] joshgillies has joined the channel
[21:53] voodootikigod__: still trying to track down what is happening before reproducible test
[21:53] voodootikigod__: https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport
[21:54] isaacs: i've got linux mint
[21:54] voodootikigod__: got it
[21:54] voodootikigod__: ok
[21:54] voodootikigod__: so here is what i found
[21:54] voodootikigod__: if the artifacts even though they are gitignore are present
[21:54] voodootikigod__: so in my case the native .node file
[21:55] voodootikigod__: the npm publish tar balls from the local dir
[21:55] voodootikigod__: takes the artifacts
[21:55] voodootikigod__: and publishes them as the tarball
[21:55] voodootikigod__: not sure if that is intentional or not
[21:55] voodootikigod__: or FAD
[21:55] voodootikigod__: but thats what was happening
[21:56] isaacs: which artifacts?
[21:56] jxson has joined the channel
[21:56] voodootikigod__: so for node-serialport, when I run make it builds the native code and puts it in the cwd
[21:56] voodootikigod__: native code compiled to node_serialport.node
[21:56] voodootikigod__: and i run tests
[21:56] isaacs: i see
[21:56] voodootikigod__: way way happy happy
[21:56] isaacs: right
[21:56] voodootikigod__: then npm publish
[21:57] isaacs: there's nothing in npm to automatically ignore .node files.
[21:57] voodootikigod__: it will tar ball that .node file
[21:57] isaacs: yes.
[21:57] voodootikigod__: yea
[21:57] voodootikigod__: since it sees it there
[21:57] isaacs: if it's in a build/ folder, it won't be included by default.
[21:57] booo has joined the channel
[21:57] voodootikigod__: it doesn't create ite
[21:57] isaacs: or you can exclude it specifically
[21:57] isaacs: by putting *.node in .npmignore or .gitignore
[21:57] voodootikigod__: it is in git ignore
[21:57] isaacs: hm… ok
[21:57] isaacs: lemme try.
[21:58] voodootikigod__: https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport/blob/6ae6153e64fdf19c92d636a39834335aecc08c9d/.gitignore
[21:59] isaacs: voodootikigod: right
[21:59] isaacs: voodootikigod: npm -v <-- what's that, exactly?
[21:59] MrTopf has joined the channel
[21:59] voodootikigod__: 1.1.0-beta-7
[22:00] isaacs: https://gist.github.com/1557166
[22:00] isaacs: works for me?
[22:01] isaacs: voodootikigod: i'm not getting any .node file in the root getting added to the tarball
[22:01] isaacs: voodootikigod: serialport_native.node is there.
[22:01] isaacs: but not in the tarball
[22:01] isaacs: so…. i dunno?
[22:02] voodootikigod__: is publish only using pack?
[22:02] isaacs: voodootikigod: publish is using `npm cache add`, and pack does the saem step, then just copies the tarball into the cwd so you can look at it
[22:03] voodootikigod__: hmm
[22:03] FIQ has joined the channel
[22:04] isaacs: voodootikigod: why do you suspect it's adding that file?
[22:04] isaacs: $ npm view serialport dist.tarball -s | xargs curl -s | tar ztv | grep node
[22:04] isaacs: doesn't show anything
[22:04] voodootikigod__: check the current version
[22:04] isaacs: yeah
[22:04] isaacs: i'm checking it ^
[22:04] stelleg has joined the channel
[22:04] voodootikigod__: 0.7.3

[22:05] voodootikigod__: wget https://registry.npmjs.org/serialport/-/serialport-0.7.3.tgz --no-check-certificate
[22:05] voodootikigod__: why is it picking up wafpickle-7 c4ch release etc
[22:05] jxson_ has joined the channel
[22:06] isaacs: voodootikigod: because it ignores ./build/, not ./serialport_native/build/
[22:06] voodootikigod__: so its ./build not **/build
[22:06] voodootikigod__: ok
[22:06] bradleymeck: isaacs, if i want to install a module for both the 0.6 and then 0.4 branches of node can npm compile against a directory instead of the standard path for includes?
[22:06] isaacs: voodootikigod: rigth
[22:06] voodootikigod__: and i can add that with npmignore right
[22:06] isaacs: voodootikigod: yes, or to .gitignore, which is respected if there's no .npmignore file presenet
[22:07] isaacs: bradleymeck: just do it in js, man
[22:07] MatthewS has joined the channel
[22:07] bradleymeck: waah, /goes to read some code

[22:08] jlank has joined the channel
[22:09] nym has joined the channel
[22:09] isaacs: voodootikigod: yeah, in 0.7.3, you're not ignoring the .node file.
[22:09] isaacs: $ cat .npmignore 
[22:09] isaacs: serialport_native/build
[22:09] isaacs: you're only ignoring the serialport_native/build folder.
[22:09] voodootikigod__: i just updated it
[22:09] isaacs: voodootikigod: and it is indeed ignoring that.
[22:10] voodootikigod__: am pushing out all of the with --force
[22:10] voodootikigod__: so if you pull now
[22:10] voodootikigod__: its updated

[22:10] slajax: Anyone have advice about how to handle migrations with nodejs + mongo?
[22:10] isaacs: np.
[22:10] voodootikigod__: did something of this sort change recently
[22:11] isaacs: voodootikigod: yeah, the ignorefile stuff is a mess.
[22:11] voodootikigod__: or have i kept it clean before every publish (that seems impossible)
[22:11] isaacs: that's why i'm rewriting glob(3) in js
[22:11] voodootikigod__: cool
[22:11] isaacs: voodootikigod: the intent is to match .gitignore exactly
[22:11] slajax: is there a DB migration tool anyone uses?
[22:11] voodootikigod__: that would be great
[22:11] isaacs: so, if a .gitignore keeps it out of git, then the exact same .npmignore should keep it out of npm.
[22:11] isaacs: there are still warts.
[22:11] isaacs: doing it right is kind of hard.

[22:35] _jzl has joined the channel
[22:35] torvalamo: and yes you probably need to restart
[22:36] eeemsi_: voodootikigod__: if you should find a solution please feel free to query me
[22:36] dave2081: Thanks
[22:36] isaacs: dave2081: you can cop[y and paste from cmd.  Do <Alt>-<space> E K, select with the mouse, press <Enter>
[22:36] isaacs: dave2081: <Alt><Space> E P to paste
[22:36] Druide_ has joined the channel
[22:37] isaacs: dave2081: you can also run a command with >file.txt to direct to a file.
[22:37] dave2081: Thanks @isaacs , thats good to know
[22:37] isaacs: np
[22:37] voodootikigod__: slajax: https://gist.github.com/4f45ea7eae7fb8306f63
[22:37] dave2081: i'm learning things in linux, mac os and windows all the time and I get confused sometimes
[22:37] isaacs: :)
[22:37] torvalamo: you should get cygwin though.. easier to work with when you're gonna do ssh, git, and stuff
[22:38] torvalamo: and you can install npm and node there and work with them in a unix environment
[22:38] tbranyen: cygwin blows, i'd rather use a linux vm
[22:38] tbranyen: sooo slowwww
[22:38] dinarcon has joined the channel
[22:38] torvalamo: cygwin isn't slow
[22:38] isaacs: torvalamo: ew
[22:38] torvalamo: it's 2012
[22:38] tbranyen: its hella slow
[22:38] tbranyen: yeah exactly its 2012 and its slowwww
[22:38] torvalamo: works fine for me
[22:38] isaacs: torvalamo: just install git and have it add all the mingw utils
[22:38] dave2081: I'll look into that. I might just ssh into my linux box as well. I've got node installed there too. 
[22:38] isaacs: torvalamo: then you get bash, vim, everything.
[22:39] isaacs: torvalamo: cygwin is a pile of garbage.  it's not just slowness.
[22:39] isaacs: it's nothing but pain.
[22:39] torvalamo: better than cmd
[22:39] dave2081: I have git
[22:39] slajax: Thanks voodootikigod_
[22:39] voodootikigod__: np
[22:39] isaacs: torvalamo: but soooo much worse than mingw utils bash!!
[22:39] arosenberg has joined the channel
[22:40] torvalamo: speaking of prejudice, mingw was horrible a few years ago
[22:40] torvalamo: so i haven't touched it since
[22:40] torvalamo: ;)
[22:40] isaacs: torvalamo: if you get the msysgit stuff, and then have it install all the goodies, you get all that stuff.
[22:41] isaacs: it's awesomely handy
[22:41] torvalamo: i once installed every single package with cygwin, didn't make it any slower.. it doesn't load everything you dont use...
[22:41] tbranyen: i'd rather just use linux ^_^

[22:42] arosenberg: dumb n00b question: is there any write up somewhere on atomicity w/r/t events and timers?
[22:42] bradleymeck: torvalamo, cmd is better than powershell :( (for most actual automation outside of VS scripting)
[22:42] mpavel has joined the channel
[22:43] gwoo has joined the channel
[22:43] torvalamo: what's powershell?
[22:43] Pilate: windows scripting language
[22:44] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[22:44] torvalamo: so it's trying to emulate unix without actually going unix?
[22:44] mpavel has left the channel
[22:44] CoverSlide: exactly
[22:44] torvalamo: typical
[22:44] bradleymeck: without piping :(
[22:44] bradleymeck: or env vars (though you can get them with some really wierd commands)

[22:45] stdarg: Heya, does anyone know how to globally capture all http.ServerResponse objects for logging?
[22:45] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[22:45] stdarg: There does not seem to be a 'response' event, like the 'request' event.
[22:46] bradleymeck: stdarg, correct there is not a *global* way to capture that from all servers but there is also not a global way to capture all requests from all servers
[22:46] torm3nt has joined the channel
[22:46] CoverSlide: what data would you be looking for from the response object?
[22:46] dwhittle has joined the channel
[22:46] stdarg: I can add a hook for a request event and it seems to work for me.
[22:47] bradleymeck: on a single server sure
[22:47] stdarg: I would e looking for the headers and body, to log what my server sends.
[22:47] alek_b has joined the channel
[22:48] CoverSlide: maybe you can monkeypatch http.ServerResponse.prototype.end
[22:49] stdarg: Hmm, I hadn't thought of that. Thanks for that idea.
[22:49] stdarg: I'll try it.
[22:49] CoverSlide: but you'd need to capture all data events too, since i don't think it'd save that on the object
[22:49] CoverSlide: if so, then that'd be a real hog on memory
[22:50] stdarg: It would be for debugging for 3rd party developers.

[23:43] vkandy: guys i have a silly problem but i am not sure how to handle it best. I download an xml file periodically via http and parse it. sometimes download process begins while the file is being updated on the server side ...
[23:43] vkandy: obviously if i download the xml while its being updated, it wont be well formed and my parsing fails ..
[23:44] vkandy: whats the best way to "detect" that a file is being updated ... any events i could make use of??
[23:44] saschagehlich: vkandy: download the xml to a temporary location, after it has been downloaded successfully, move it over to the real path
[23:45] saschagehlich: or replace the current file
[23:45] vkandy: thanks .. i am doing that but is that the only way? 
[23:46] redir_ has joined the channel
[23:46] vkandy: problem is i can't tell when the file is written completely on the server side so its a try until u succeed kind of approach ..
[23:47] tonymilne: vkandy i did the same thing
[23:47] joshkehn has joined the channel
[23:47] tonymilne: and i used a file watcher, and just kept a 10 second set interval timeout, that kept refreshing a flag saying updating... 
[23:47] Revernd has joined the channel
[23:47] clarkfischer: how often does this thing get updated? you could just try parsing it, and if it isn't well-formed, retry once after 500ms or something. Obviously if it's getting updated every 3 seconds that won't work.
[23:47] tonymilne: maybe you could do something similar using fs stat and modified dates etc?
[23:48] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[23:48] jamescarr: I'm trying to use connect-form but I keep getting  message: 'parser error, 0 of 40113 bytes parsed'  as an error
[23:48] jamescarr: any ideas?
[23:48] vkandy: i have to first issue a http request and on response, read the file and parse it ...
[23:49] clarkfischer: vkandy: you could also use etags
[23:49] vkandy: i wish there was a stats like command! or is there
[23:50] clarkfischer: the server really oughtn't be serving you half of the old file, half of the new, though
[23:50] vkandy: clarkfischer: yep thats the problem with etags

[23:50] tonymilne: vkandy thats kinda what i did,

[23:52] tonymilne: ahh :s i see.

[23:53] vkandy: if i could stream the file while its being updated that'd be nice too!
