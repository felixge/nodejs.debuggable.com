[00:00] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: it wouldnt be so bad "normally" but the way node modules are set up
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: it becomes extremely useless

[02:37] Crshman: is there any way to get around this?
[02:39] dylang: Crshman: i'm not sure what you're trying to do - /home/'"+data+"'/" - are those single quotes needed?
[02:39] Crshman: the single quotes prevent "xss"-ish behavior

[02:40] dylang: Crshman: ah, cool
[02:40] Crshman: without the single quotes, the du runs, then the ifconfig runs
[02:40] Crshman: single quotes executes it literally

[03:02] Jantire: hi all
[03:02] Jantire: so I have a sort of unusual question
[03:04] Jantire: I'm creating something in Silverlight (no I don't care if you have a vendetta against Microsoft), and I hate the way WCF works (normal method of data-driven applications in Silverlight), so I was thinking about using Node.js and NowJS for all database connectivity, using the HTML bridge in Silverlight to run functions on the web page it's hosted in that gets data from a node.js server
[03:06] pyrotechnick: Jantire: what is your question exactly?
[03:06] Jantire: pyrotechnick, Is that for any major reason a bad idea?
[03:08] pyrotechnick: there are no bad ideaz

[03:09] pyrotechnick: only bad solutions
[03:09] Jantire: pyrotechnick, I mean from a security or speed standpoint
[03:09] pyrotechnick: in this case i wouldnt say it's bad, just...complex
[03:09] niftylettuce: what is best approach to pass a file path to a node js function for user download?
[03:09] niftylettuce: is there a stack overflow example someone knows of?
[03:09] niftylettuce: simply user clicks a file and nodejs download
[03:10] pyrotechnick: niftylettuce: you just want to host a page with file downloads on node.js?
[03:10] niftylettuce: pyrotechnick: yeah b/c files aren't accessible in the public folder
[03:10] pyrotechnick: what framework are you using, if any?
[03:10] Jantire: pyrotechnick, How is it complex? It's instead of using Ajax or being forced to use something like SQL Server
[03:10] niftylettuce: just node js and html5
[03:10] pyrotechnick: i can show you how to do it in express
[03:11] pyrotechnick: yes but in node? are you using a library for your app or have you written it all yourself?
[03:11] niftylettuce: used a couple modules
[03:12] pyrotechnick: connect(
[03:12] pyrotechnick:   connect.static(__dirname + '/public')
[03:12] pyrotechnick: ).listen(3000);
[03:12] niftylettuce: nodejs to upload files
[03:12] pyrotechnick: ohhh upload
[03:12] niftylettuce: no no
[03:12] niftylettuce: i mean i already have a nodejs upload script
[03:12] pyrotechnick: ok
[03:12] pyrotechnick: well
[03:12] niftylettuce: i just need it so when user clicks on a file then the download button they dl file
[03:12] niftylettuce: using nodejs stream or whatever?
[03:12] niftylettuce: idk
[03:12] pyrotechnick: im not sure what you're using to do your http
[03:13] pyrotechnick: but if you use connect or express which sits on connect
[03:13] pyrotechnick: then you can just attach the "static" middleware (module) like i pasted above
[03:13] hij1nx has joined the channel
[03:13] ilowhy has joined the channel
[03:13] pyrotechnick: then anything in /public will be publically accessible at like http://domain.tld/PATH

[03:14] pyrotechnick: and put a link to it in /public/index.html
[03:14] pyrotechnick: then it should work
[03:14] niftylettuce: pyrotechnick: like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3828888/download-tar-file-via-nodejs/3829263#3829263
[03:14] pyrotechnick: that is how you do it yourself
[03:14] gkatsev: I created a new module, let me know what you think: https://github.com/gkatsev/set.js It's a Set implementation in JavaScript.
[03:14] pyrotechnick: i.e. without a library
[03:14] pyrotechnick: if you're trying to learn it's good
[03:14] Crshman: so if I have a node user account on the server, and run $sudo node from within that account, does it defeat the purpose of not running node as root?
[03:14] pyrotechnick: if you're trying to make an efficient and robust app i suggest you use connect+static middleware
[03:15] niftylettuce: hmm
[03:15] pyrotechnick: yes Crshman, usually
[03:15] pyrotechnick: there are ways to run node on 80 without root
[03:15] Crshman: that's what I thought
[03:15] Crshman: well that's not the issue
[03:15] Crshman: i posted my code above, and i'm having issues with killing sudo'd processes
[03:16] Crshman: node runs unprivileged, and when it tries to kill a sudo'd process it craps out
[03:16] techwraith: Crshman: that's expected behaviour, no?
[03:16] Crshman: sure, it makes sense
[03:16] Crshman: check out my code: https://gist.github.com/914816
[03:17] Crshman: how do I fix that privilege error
[03:17] techwraith: Does it crap out when you run the master process as root?
[03:17] Crshman: no, it does not
[03:17] Crshman: I tried that
[03:17] Crshman: and it sends the "kill" command sudo'd and it works great
[03:17] techwraith: That's your answer then
[03:17] Crshman: but from a security perspective, is it wise to do so....that's the next question
[03:18] techwraith: I would say that code looks pretty unsafe to run as root
[03:18] Crshman: yeah...
[03:18] techwraith: but it depends on how mission critical this box is for you
[03:19] Crshman: i think i'm going to have to go back to the drawing board in terms of permissions
[03:19] Crshman: because right now the node user can't access other users' directories for the du command
[03:20] techwraith: You could set up groups and handle it with group permissions, but that's pretty complex
[03:20] indutny has joined the channel
[03:20] Crshman: right
[03:20] Crshman: horribly complex
[03:20] Crshman: haha
[03:21] Crshman: since user accounts on the machine are constantly added/removed
[03:21] techwraith: Sounds like a bitch

[03:21] techwraith: What do you do when jimBastard is around?
[03:22] Nexxy: hide
[03:22] mikegerwitz: Crshman: Alternatively you could create a shell script that is executed by node, and that can run your command. Node should have permission to kill the script. Then you also have the benefit of doing the processing in that script ;) Which may be cleaner

[03:27] Crshman: that seems to work for the node.js script
[03:27] Crshman: no errors are presented
[03:27] Crshman: that seems reasonably safe
[03:28] techwraith: Crshman: Gonna have to talk to an ops guy about that one. Seems pretty safe to me, but still a little scary

[03:31] Crshman: and no ssh access to that account directly
[03:31] Crshman: you have to su to it from another account
[03:32] techwraith: yep, makes sense
[03:32] Crshman: i'm going through all this trouble, but I figure the account I su to the node account with will do all the server screwing up

[05:31] jeffmoss: not really no, that would be interesting though
[05:32] wilmoore has joined the channel
[05:32] AAA_awright: Or at least libraries
[05:32] jeffmoss: like memcache but better, I dunno
[05:32] AAA_awright: jeffmoss: What's the comparible distributed project for another language?
[05:32] jeffmoss: I feel like memcache is actually going to create a worse situation in my app, I'm thinking it'd be better to build the app in a distributed fashion
[05:32] jeffmoss: i.e. this request goes to server 1.2.3.4
[05:33] jeffmoss: I was just curious if someone has had some great ideas in this area
[05:34] jeffmoss: seems like redis is probably a good thing for node
[05:36] perezd: jeffmoss: i don't really understand
[05:36] perezd: you are saying your data is spread across 4 servers?
[05:36] perezd: and 1 request fans out to 4 procs?
[05:36] jeffmoss: no, my app is large and caches a lot of data
[05:36] jeffmoss: which is redundant processing, per core
[05:36] jeffmoss: per server, per core
[05:37] perezd: and you need them to share stae?
[05:37] perezd: state?
[05:37] jeffmoss: but marshalling everything into a string and eval() on the other end seems like it'd be somewhat wasteful
[05:37] perezd: redis + pub/sub would probably be a good solution
[05:37] perezd: it'd allow you to create a state machine
[05:38] perezd: http://redis.io/topics/pubsub
[05:39] AAA_awright: eval() is rather expensive
[05:39] perezd: redis is a good system for sort of queuing data around quickly
[05:39] AAA_awright: jeffmoss: I just run four instances of Node.js for four processors and put them behind a load balancer
[05:39] jeffmoss: perezd: yeah this looks pretty interesting, might come in handy for some things.. I had another thought
[05:39] perezd: pub/sub allows you to maintain the async nature of processing
[05:40] perezd: AAA_awright: yeah, but each proc memory is isolated
[05:40] perezd: which is good/bad
[05:40] perezd: depending on your needs
[05:40] jeffmoss: I'm thinking it'd be best if the user is routed to the node instance with the right data... layered clusters of node.js server
[05:40] perezd: if you want 1 of 4 processes to be able to work on a similar state mutation, you need a shared state
[05:40] AAA_awright: Yeah it would be nice if you could share memory or something
[05:40] perezd: AAA_awright: redis++
[05:40] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[05:40] perezd: its really lightweight and good at this
[05:40] jeffmoss: persistent user processes on the server, that'd be cool
[05:40] perezd: because you can let it hold data structures, and publish events for mutations
[05:40] AAA_awright: perezd: May as well just use some sort of IPC
[05:41] perezd: AAA_awright: but thats going to need to then handle sync
[05:41] perezd: via some sort of gossip 
[05:41] pquerna: oh, you mean like, cassandra
[05:41] ljackson has joined the channel
[05:41] perezd: that can work too, but redis is really good at just being a data structure server/wrapper around memory with some async events
[05:41] perezd: its pretty lightweight conceptually
[05:42] AAA_awright: Yeah if I'm gonna use a database I'm gonna use a real one like Cassandra, MySQL, maybe MongoDB?
[05:42] perezd: its not about data storage
[05:42] perezd: its just about centralization 
[05:42] perezd: its totally transient, I'd assume
[05:42] jeffmoss: redis fits the whole async architecture the best yeah, memcache is cool too but won't help with atomic operations much
[05:42] harlanji has joined the channel
[05:42] perezd: well, just my $0.02

[08:01] SubStack: no-gooder: that is an issue for whatever templating system you're using

[08:03] varioust has joined the channel
[08:03] SubStack: how are you updating the dom?
[08:03] ElDios: no-gooder can't you simply validate the input?
[08:04] no-gooder: SubStack, via jquery
[08:04] meso has joined the channel
[08:04] SubStack: no-gooder: then just .text(msg)
[08:04] no-gooder: ElDios, you mean liek replace()
[08:04] Phyllio has left the channel
[08:04] SubStack: takes care of all of that shit for you
[08:05] ElDios: no-gooder if you feel like you know *what* to replace, do so
[08:05] ElDios: you could also HTML-escape it and do as SubStack suggested
[08:05] SubStack: you don't need to do anything more, just .text()
[08:06] no-gooder: SubStack, .text(msg) is a really good point.
[08:06] no-gooder: SubStack, but i'm using append() i ned to add it
[08:06] no-gooder: need*
[08:06] SubStack: .append($('<span>').text(msg))
[08:08] ElDios: guys while you're still here :P could you suggest me a good nodejs learning source? (screencast, pdf, whatever)

[08:13] jimt has joined the channel
[08:13] jeffmoss: https://gist.github.com/d2fec07d094ca6fbc6ea
[08:13] jeffmoss: can someone look at this, what happens is it finds 2 filse
[08:14] jeffmoss: in widgets/
[08:14] jeffmoss: var widgetModule = require(__dirname + '/../widgets/' + files[i]);
[08:14] jeffmoss: that object should go into the closure there
[08:15] jeffmoss: one widget is named foo, other is named bar, so it should set Parser.prototype.foo and Parser.prototype.bar, each will call new Foo and new Bar respectively
[08:15] jeffmoss: but what happens is whichever file is loaded last is the module that is initialized for each method
[08:15] jeffmoss: foo and bar both call new Bar
[08:15] ElDios: jeffmoss I suppose you should change the var name too
[08:15] ElDios: like 
[08:16] __tosh has joined the channel
[08:16] ElDios: var widgetModule[i] = require(__dirname + '/../widgets/' + files[i])
[08:16] FireFly has joined the channel
[08:16] ElDios: or something like that
[08:16] jeffmoss: well i will change
[08:16] jeffmoss: can't put i in the closure
[08:16] ElDios: just a fast guess anyway
[08:16] pt_tr has joined the channel
[08:16] ElDios: and still I suppose that code would be cleaner if you use the foreach loop :P
[08:17] jeffmoss: I actually can't figure out any way to do this, from what I know, var widgetModule = should alwasy create the new object that gets put in the closure
[08:17] jeffmoss: I don't understand how it could end up with a reference to the same module from both function
[08:18] shaunau: jeffmoss use the debugger.
[08:18] jeffmoss: what debugger?
[08:18] shaunau: the node one
[08:18] jeffmoss: the interactive environment?
[08:18] shaunau: node debug app.js
[08:19] shaunau: and put debugger; where you want to break

[08:21] shaunau: k
[08:21] bentruyman has joined the channel
[08:21] jeffmoss: 12 Apr 03:20:01 - Loaded widget foo
[08:21] jeffmoss: 12 Apr 03:20:01 - Loaded widget bar
[08:22] jeffmoss: and when I call obj.foo() it calls new Bar
[08:22] jeffmoss: if I reverse the order that they load then bar will call new Foo
[08:23] shaunau: :)
[08:23] shaunau: "its a feature"
[08:23] jeffmoss: it's doing something funky with require I think
[08:24] jimt has joined the channel

[12:46] ElDios: Gelegrodan why is the server shutting down? Ctrl+C? exit? no more istructions?
[12:47] mikegerwitz: Gelegrodan: process.on( 'exit' )
[12:47] mikegerwitz: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.5/api/process.html#event_exit_
[12:47] Gelegrodan: ElDios: in this case ctrl+c yes
[12:47] ElDios: mikegerwitz I suppose that would not be executed on Ctrl+C
[12:47] jscheel: Gelegrodan: if it shuts down from an exception that isn't caught, your server monitoring will need to catch it, I believe
[12:47] jscheel: oh
[12:47] tjholowaychuk: multiple inheritance ftw
[12:47] mikegerwitz: ElDios: It will
[12:47] jscheel: nm, you're looking for a forced shutdown

[12:48] Gelegrodan: im spawning a child process i want to kill when the server shutdowns
[12:48] tjholowaychuk: you can trap SIGINT
[12:48] tjholowaychuk: CTRL+C
[12:48] Gelegrodan: ive noticed they stay (not so strange) when i ctrl+c the server

[13:14] bergie has joined the channel
[13:14] secoif_: I want to test web app stack performance
[13:15] secoif_: Any suggestions?
[13:15] killfill: am im doing something wrong? or its just cannot use it like that?
[13:15] tjholowaychuk: killfill: app.namespace callbacks are not request-level callbacks
[13:15] secoif_: Its a rails app, and it's real slow in places
[13:15] tjholowaychuk: the other app.namespace() calls within that callback are used for nesting
[13:16] tjholowaychuk: think of it more as a "block" than a callback
[13:16] tjholowaychuk: so req.param.module is not there because there is no request at that point

[13:19] tjholowaychuk: secoif_: oh god, that woudl be easy for node
[13:19] tjholowaychuk: no problem
[13:19] baudehlo: secoif_: then it's unlikely to be rails.
[13:19] killfill: yup thanks.
[13:19] baudehlo: more likely your DB
[13:20] mheadd has joined the channel
[13:20] secoif_: It's a bit of both, CPU on app server up to 100% on my teat
[13:20] secoif_: Test
[13:20] secoif_: Test box.
[13:21] secoif_: For very few simultaneous connections
[13:21] baudehlo: but that could be because you're returning too many rows from your DB and trying to process them in a funny way.

[13:21] postwait has joined the channel
[13:21] dachary1 has joined the channel
[13:22] tjholowaychuk: secoif_: shouldn't be an issue for node, our app is massive and we could handle 100k in less than ~2.5 minutes easy
[13:22] tjholowaychuk: and our app is not even remotely optimized
[13:22] sreeix has joined the channel
[13:22] baudehlo: right, but you can do stupid stuff in any language :)
[13:23] secoif_: baudehlo: Thats likely. Basically, a rewrite would be ideal but would be hard to sell to managemwnt after theyve been throwing money at it for 3 years
[13:23] muz1: tjholowaychuk: out of interest what app is that?

[13:24] drudge: good morning fellas
[13:25] tjholowaychuk: muz1: yeah
[13:25] tjholowaychuk: we have about 100 or so jade templates
[13:25] tjholowaychuk: and 16k lines of stylus

[13:27] ElDios: for stylus
[13:27] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[13:27] baudehlo: secoif_: yeah see there's no way that's rail's fault. That's a design/db issue.

[13:27] tjholowaychuk: secoif_: ours is 40g
[13:27] tjholowaychuk: apparently
[13:27] secoif_: baudehlo:  I think too many joins, too much 3NF
[13:28] baudehlo: what db are you using?
[13:28] tjholowaychuk: ElDios: I have a lib kinda like compass I'm releasing right away
[13:28] tjholowaychuk: havent had much time to work won it

[13:29] n2liquid: does anyone here know if there's a one-to-one correlation between Mongoose's models and MongoDB's collections?
[13:30] tjholowaychuk: i dont think we have that much data
[13:30] tjholowaychuk: mongo just likes to be fat

[13:30] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[13:30] n2liquid: anyone?
[13:30] lukegalea: n2liquid: ya..
[13:30] lukegalea: n2liquid: Except if you have embedded schemas
[13:30] n2liquid: ah, yeah
[13:30] lukegalea: it will create a mongo collection, even though it will never get used.
[13:31] n2liquid: lukegalea: I've inserted a document in a collection with the same name as my schema
[13:31] muz1: damn I have just realised I haven't done much html is a long time
[13:31] muz1: hah
[13:31] n2liquid: but I can't find it from the code

[13:32] secoif_: What he said.
[13:32] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[13:32] n2liquid: lukegalea: oh yeah, indeed I called findOne with a small query by username and password
[13:32] lukegalea: n2liquid: and no luck eh?
[13:32] n2liquid: the same query that works on the shell, btw
[13:32] n2liquid: lukegalea: no luck
[13:32] lukegalea: well, I've had no problems there.. but I can suggest one crazy trick
[13:32] killfill: whats the most fun db to work with node?  couch, redis, mongo or riak?  (just need to store list of things, add and remove)
[13:32] lukegalea: launch mongo with very verbose settings
[13:32] n2liquid: ah, ok
[13:32] lukegalea: so it logs every query
[13:32] n2liquid: four v's?
[13:33] lukegalea: ya
[13:33] n2liquid: ok
[13:33] lukegalea: then watch to see what mongoose is running
[13:34] n2liquid: lukegalea: oh, that's great, nice tip!
[13:34] ElDios: killfill if you need to store simple lists just go with redis
[13:34] secoif_: tjholowaychuk: Know if your production guys use any performance profilimg tools
[13:34] ElDios: big things and blobs are more comfortable when in mongo or couch
[13:35] tjholowaychuk: secoif_: we are not really there yet, we've profiled here and there but nothing serious
[13:35] killfill: ok
[13:35] tjholowaychuk: have't really had a need to yet, things are going smooth
[13:36] secoif_: Yeah, trying to sell node to management you see
[13:36] secoif_: Got some room to play but will need hard stats
[13:36] secoif_: I guess ab/seige will do for
[13:37] tjholowaychuk: well the bottlenecks are relatively the same as any other platform
[13:37] secoif_: now
[13:37] n2liquid: lukegalea: great, I found it out
[13:37] tjholowaychuk: ours is certainly the db
[13:37] n2liquid: just so you know
[13:37] n2liquid: Mongoose appends an "s" to the end of the schema name
[13:37] lukegalea: n2liquid: sweet. Glad to hear.
[13:37] n2liquid: and makes it lowercase
[13:37] n2liquid: lukegalea: a bit stupid, don't you think? I mean, some plurals don't even end with and "s"...

[13:41] ElDios: italian
[13:42] n2liquid: ElDios: I see; they use that a lot here in Brazil

[13:45] augustl: as in, am I or node.js at fault here ;)
[13:47] jscheel: are there any events for process.stdout? Looking through to documentation, but I'm not seeing anything.

[13:49] n2liquid: for some reason my shell queries appear like this in the logs:
[13:49] n2liquid: Tue Apr 12 10:47:58 [conn1] query: voicein.accounts{ usr: "n2liquid", pwd: "1234" }
[13:50] n2liquid: that's good; it works
[13:50] n2liquid: but Mongoose queries appear like this:
[13:50] n2liquid: Tue Apr 12 10:48:11 [conn2] query: voicein.accounts{ query: { usr: "n2liquid", pwd: "1234" } }
[13:50] n2liquid: and they don't work
[13:50] n2liquid: what the hell?
[13:50] Gelegrodan: they are wrapped in query
[13:50] ElDios: augustl put a var fs = require('fs'); below the https require
[13:50] Gelegrodan: so yiou have to use query.usr
[13:51] Gelegrodan: instead of jus usr
[13:51] ElDios: Gelegrodan did it work like I wrote on gist?
[13:51] augustl: ElDios: ah, the paste is out of context
[13:51] augustl: ElDios: I'm not getting fs errors
[13:51] ElDios: okok :)
[13:51] n2liquid: Gelegrodan: you mean all of my documents should have a "query" root?

[13:52] Gelegrodan: guess it works :)

[13:54] NuckingFuts has joined the channel
[13:54] n2liquid: Gelegrodan: that's not the problem; the query returns null because of this added query root

[13:56] tjholowaychuk: n2liquid: it's 7:00am here man
[13:56] ElDios: anyway it's simply a matter of Ctrl+Z
[13:56] ElDios: and then kill the process
[13:56] tjholowaychuk: im only up because I couldnt sleep

[14:02] augustl: a difference between the two pastes?

[14:03] augustl: I'm making the request in the listen callback of the server, with the https module ;)

[14:51] Buttons840: considering node has adopted many features of twisted python, i assume you can make non-blocking calls to c libs with callbacks?  it looks like i would use the child module for this?

[15:20] jscheel: Gelegrodan: what is "yourthing" though? How does it get the stdout?

[15:22] jetienne: MikeW: underscore templates works on node and in browser
[15:22] jscheel: Gelegrodan: it's just everything that's written to stdout

[16:15] tbranyen: as much as i disagree with crockford i find my code often passes jslint
[16:15] tbranyen: heh
[16:16] mikegerwitz: tbranyen: Mine doesn't because I absolutely refuse the strict JSON syntax in my code ._. He's crazy! lol
[16:16] mikegerwitz: { "foo": "bar" }
[16:16] tbranyen: mikegerwitz: i don't know what that means
[16:16] tbranyen: strict JSON syntax?
[16:16] tbranyen: JSON is a defined standard, object literals arne't
[16:17] tbranyen: well the way i worded that is confusing
[16:17] mikegerwitz: tbranyen: Yes, but jslint parses object literals as if they were JSON : /
[16:17] tbranyen: no it doesn't?
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: jslint sucks
[16:17] Schmallon has joined the channel

[16:17] tbranyen: passes jslint
[16:17] tbranyen: thats not valid json
[16:17] pandeiro: you only need to quote an object key if it has non-alphanumeric chars i think
[16:17] JianMeng has joined the channel
[16:17] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: why do you think that
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: if your language needs some kind of "lint" thing, it's a fail
[16:17] tbranyen: pandeiro: yeah you need to quote anything that can't work as a normal variable name
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: but IMO people just need to stop the suck
[16:18] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: so C is a fail?
[16:18] ruggedcoder has joined the channel
[16:18] blowery: dude, all languages have a lint
[16:18] mikegerwitz: tbranyen: Huh, I'm not sure why it didn't pass for me, then. I had to literally remove the code from jslint.
[16:18] tbranyen: linting exists for most languages
[16:18] timcosgrove has joined the channel
[16:18] blowery: ACTION makes a new language called lint
[16:19] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: its handy to have all code passing some sort of checker to ensure you don't forget semicolons (if you care about them) sort of thing
[16:19] tbranyen: i prefer jshint since i can modify it easier
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: I think it's valid for statically typed languages
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: but for stuff like js, just... learn the language
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: and maintain a style that you accept
[16:19] jetienne: (btw there is a jshint. http://jshint.com/)
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: simple as that
[16:19] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: but how do you enforce that without a checker?
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: eyes?
[16:20] tbranyen: if you have multiple people on a large project
[16:20] mikegerwitz: tjholowaychuk: If you have a group of 10 people working on a project, commmitting 1000s of lines of code a day, a lint too is necessary ;)
[16:20] mikegerwitz: tool*
[16:20] tbranyen: i dunno i'm partially involved with the jquery project and they get a shit ton of pull requests that don't pass jslint
[16:20] PhilK has joined the channel
[16:20] tbranyen: and would end up failing minification because nobody bothered to test

[16:21] tbranyen: single space between parens is the standard

[16:23] Kiba: but do it as simple and as painless as possible
[16:23] aconbere has joined the channel

[17:16] creationix: for..in is *really* slow
[17:16] gkatsev: you can also do Object.keys(obj).forEach
[17:17] jonaslund: creationix: it is?
[17:17] V1 has joined the channel
[17:17] creationix: Object.keys(obj).forEach isn't bad, it's a pretty good compromise between speed and usability
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: yeah, we benched it the one time it was at least like 300% slower
[17:17] pandeiro: gkatsev, nice thinking..
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: something like that
[17:17] jonaslund: 300% slower than ?
[17:17] ilowhy has joined the channel
[17:17] creationix: if you don't mind adding non-enumarable properties to Object.prototype
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: than for/in
[17:18] drudge: man mongoose is killing me lately
[17:18] creationix: I thought it was worse than 300%
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: might have been
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: something massive
[17:18] jonaslund: for..in slower than for/in ? :)
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: though I think with some cases it was similar, with objects only containing a few keys
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: cant remember
[17:18] creationix: jonaslund: for .forEach and .map for Object.prototype https://github.com/creationix/proto/blob/master/lib/proto.js
[17:18] lukus has joined the channel
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: no lol Object.keys() vs for/in
[17:18] creationix: jonaslund: for..in is the same as for/in
[17:18] tjholowaychuk: jonaslund: keys.forEach/map/whatever you want
[17:19] charlenopires_ has joined the channel
[17:19] jonaslund: erm. so object.keys was much faster then ?
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: for/in
[17:19] creationix: back when we benchmarked things...
[17:19] Aria has joined the channel
[17:19] creationix: the fastest way was to do Object.keys and then for(;;) over the resulting array
[17:19] halfhalo: heh.. last benchmark I did was for finding if an object was an array or not
[17:20] eee_c has joined the channel
[17:20] tjholowaychuk: same with Array.prototype.slice.call() stuff, even just iterating (when I benched) and populating your own array was about 16x faster
[17:20] creationix: but second and quite close was using a forEach function like the one in proto.js
[17:20] gkatsev: yeah, for is much faster than forEach/map
[17:20] akashiraffee has joined the channel
[17:21] jonaslund: does Object.keys return the objects keys only or does it include the prototypes like for in does ?
[17:21] tbranyen: only hasOwnProperty keys
[17:21] gkatsev: apparently, a while(item = arr[i++]) doStuffWith(item) is one of the fastest ways to iterate over an array
[17:21] creationix: jonaslund: that's why it's faster
[17:21] tbranyen: and only enumerbale ones i believe as well
[17:21] creationix: it ignores prototypes
[17:21] gkatsev: yeah, only the enumerable items
[17:21] jonaslund: well
[17:21] creationix: if you want non-enumerables there is Object.getOwnPropertynames
[17:21] jonaslund: that does equalize the amount of code aswell then
[17:22] halfhalo: compared Object.prototype.toString.call(model) == "[object Array]" to typeof model && model.length!=undefined and found that the tostring way was something like 20 times slower
[17:22] creationix: the easiest to code is to monkey patch Object.prototype and then just .forEach like on arrays
[17:22] akashiraffee: Is there a quick way of accessing system environment variables in node/connect/express?
[17:22] tjholowaychuk: akashiraffee: process.env.WHATEVER
[17:22] meandi has joined the channel

[17:23] ph^ has joined the channel
[17:23] creationix: tbranyen: which?
[17:24] tbranyen: prototyping on the Object object
[17:24] creationix: you don't have to change the object prototype
[17:24] tbranyen: oh i thought you said monkey patch it
[17:24] creationix: unless you want objects to work exactely like arrays with .forEach
[17:24] creationix: sometimes I monkeypatch it
[17:24] jjmalina has joined the channel
[17:24] creationix: sometimes I just make an external forEach function that takes an object and callback
[17:24] tjholowaychuk: I think its fine to monkey patch your own stuff in app land
[17:25] tjholowaychuk: at least its your fault if you fuck stuff up then
[17:25] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:25] creationix: yeah, just don't do it in a library
[17:25] creationix: or framework
[17:25] pandeiro: ending up yoinking your proto code creationix, thanks
[17:25] tjholowaychuk: just like its fine to use coffeescript for your app

[17:25] tjholowaychuk: just dont use it for a lib
[17:25] indutny has joined the channel
[17:25] creationix: pandeiro: cool, don't worry about the copyright if you just grabbed that one
[17:25] creationix: it's practically public domain
[17:26] pandeiro: i'm just taking that part, yeah
[17:26] tbranyen: I guess i'm still stuck with the client-side thinking of JS
[17:26] indutny: CryptoStream.prototype.pause is causing problems w/ large files on tls server /cc ryah izs anyonefromjoyent
[17:26] methym: I'm just getting started with express, and see there are a few options for templating engines.  I know a lot has to do with preferred style, etc., but which one is the core/suggested one?
[17:26] tbranyen: which doesn't necessarily translate to Node
[17:27] creationix: tbranyen: what do you mean?
[17:27] pandeiro: tbranyen: i have the same problem
[17:27] creationix: tjholowaychuk: is Jade still your favorite?
[17:27] pandeiro: creationix: think he means compatibility
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: what?
[17:27] pandeiro: and extending prototypes
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: sorry
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: was gone
[17:27] wink_: indutny: what sorts of problems?
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: methym: yo
[17:27] indutny: wink_: it stops emitting 'data' event
[17:27] creationix: pandeiro: tbranyen: it's the same as in the browser
[17:27] methym: tjholowaychuk: hey
[17:28] indutny: wink_: and as consequence - packet loss
[17:28] creationix: modules don't have their own context by default
[17:28] drudge: tjholowaychuk: have you updated rubbernet to 0.94?
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: methym: there really are none specific to express, however I think on average more people use jade
[17:28] tbranyen: creationix: no its not, anything that extends an Object.prototype is subject to breaking any other code in an app
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: methym: they all have different goals / benefits so check a few out
[17:28] tbranyen: unless you mean the same is true in node
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: drudge: nope not yet
[17:28] creationix: tbranyen: right, the same is true in node
[17:28] tbranyen: Although its easier to isolate natives in Node
[17:28] tbranyen: with vm
[17:28] tbranyen: iframe hack has issues
[17:28] drudge: tjholowaychuk: it allows for monitoring kernel processes now, much more accurate readings
[17:28] creationix: one exception is that we have Object.defineProperty, so it's not as dangerous
[17:28] creationix: it can be added as non-enumerable
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: drudge: ah nice man
[17:29] methym: tjholowaychuk: ok, great.  I'd like to use the one that is the most popular just for the scenario where other devs work on the codebase.  thx!
[17:29] isaacs_ has joined the channel
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: methym: I'd still recommend trying a few, for larger teams it may be better to use something with regular html / tag soup
[17:29] tbranyen: creationix: also don't need to deal with browser quirks by extending natives in node
[17:29] tbranyen: which you have to watch for in client side code
[17:30] methym: tjholowaychuk: would that be ejs?
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: methym: anything like that, ejs, mustache, hbs, liquid, etc
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: methym: but we have 100s of jade templates so its not going anywhere
[17:30] indutny: wink_: and that's appears from time to time, not usually
[17:30] pandeiro: tbranyen, exactly, that's what i am still adjusting to... find myself wanting to write client-side stuff with all the ECMA5 syntax
[17:30] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[17:31] tbranyen: pandeiro: also why i lol when people try loading jquery in node
[17:31] tbranyen: idgi
[17:31] creationix: of course, lately all my browser code has been for webkit only and usually v8 only
[17:31] tbranyen: fun experiment i guess
[17:31] pandeiro: it would be awesome if there were a modernizr-type script that enabled all the new ECMA5 methods in older browsers
[17:31] ph^ has joined the channel
[17:31] gkatsev: tbranyen: pandeiro es5-shim ftw
[17:31] creationix: so browser is a lot like node to me
[17:31] pandeiro: gkatsev, you are making my day today
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: yeah im with creationix, i never have to deal with other browsers anymore
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: its the best thing
[17:32] gkatsev: pandeiro: glad I could help. :)
[17:32] halfhalo: do they still make browsers? jeesh
[17:32] creationix: halfhalo: I want to see fennec as a pdk app just for fun
[17:32] gkatsev: halfhalo: yeah, I just curl everything and view it in vim.

[17:33] gkatsev: halfhalo: someone has ported firefox/fennec over to webos forever and a half ago.
[17:33] creationix: shows what I know about webOS
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: " You ranked 22nd in our automated system based, so I thought it was worth reaching out to you." - Google
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: wtf
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: harvesting devs?
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: or something

[17:34] tbranyen: Google likes popular devs
[17:34] scoates has joined the channel
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: most random shit
[17:34] gkatsev: creationix: lol. But not sure if they kept up to do date with the fennec/firefox mobile development. So, it's possibly completely out-of-date
[17:34] creationix: that's what you get for having popular projects
[17:34] creationix: (that was for tjholowaychuk)
[17:34] tbranyen: gkatsev: yeah especially since they basically rewrote fennec
[17:35] c4milo: does anybody know how can I convert from markdown to html? 
[17:35] c4milo: I recall there was a module in nodejs to do that 
[17:35] c4milo: I can be wrong 
[17:36] gkatsev: there is. Try search.npmjs.org
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: use isaac's github-flavored-markdown
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: or w/e it was called
[17:36] gkatsev: tbranyen: yep.
[17:36] tmzt has joined the channel
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: markdown-js has some flaws
[17:36] gkatsev: http://www.precentral.net/prefox-firefox-your-pre
[17:36] creationix: is showdown still a good one
[17:36] creationix: or is one of the new ones better
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: namely you cannot use inline html, and it double escapes shit
[17:36] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, that's the one
[17:36] isaacs: creationix: github-flavored-markdown is showdown + all the stuff you're used to because of github readmes
[17:37] isaacs: and you can pass in an object to make it autolink sha's and stuf
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: all wrapped up in one really long name
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: :D
[17:37] isaacs: hehe, yep
[17:37] c4milo: so finally what's that haha
[17:37] creationix: I don't even know what github added
[17:37] c4milo: github-flavored-markdown?
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: yeah me neither
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: they fixed some of the paragraph related stuff i think
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: and some shorthand syntax for linking to issues n shit i dunno
[17:38] creationix: I think I use showdown and prettify for howtonode.org
[17:38] qbert has joined the channel
[17:38] isaacs: creationix: they auto-link sha's to commit links, creationix/node to your github page, etc.
[17:38] isaacs: creationix: but to do that, you have to pass in an object with an owner and repo to make things relative to
[17:38] creationix: isaacs: anything useful outside github integration?
[17:39] bartt has joined the channel
[17:39] isaacs: creationix: well.. no, not really.  http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: creationix: I think with regular markdown the paragraphs are a bit different
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: newlines are not treated as line breaks
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: or something
[17:39] isaacs: creationix: oh, yeah, different line-breaking stuf.
[17:39] drudge: http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/
[17:39] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: honestly, i find that a bit annoying.
[17:39] drudge: er
[17:39] creationix: ok, I guess that's significant
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: yeah I never noticed an issue with regular markdown
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: but it does change things
[17:39] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i like wrapping my paragraphs in my editor, and when i do that, gfm puts a bunch of <br>s in there
[17:40] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i'm probably going to fork an npm-flavored-markdown for parsing npm package docs
[17:40] c4milo: so, what's the tool? 
[17:40] isaacs: maybe auto-link between doc pages and packages.
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: cool man
[17:41] c4milo: I have a bunch of pages in github wiki that I would like to conver to html

[17:56] KRTac: what's the best way to store short-term json data?
[17:56] KRTac: i would like to keep it in memory
[17:56] mike_miller has joined the channel
[17:57] tbranyen: KRTac: make an object and cache it there?
[17:57] methym: does express have a feature similar to sinatra where the code is automatically reloaded when the are code changes?  getting tired of ^C ^ enter
[17:57] drudge: aheckmann: this line looks off https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/blob/master/lib/mongoose/index.js#L187
[17:57] KRTac: but i'm now sure if storing it in a js array or something directely in node would be a smart idea
[17:57] drudge: methym: check out cluster or node-dev
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: methym: not built in but there are many node modules that do that. I just use cluster's reload() plugin
[17:57] tbranyen: var cache = {}; cache['myid'] = myjson;  it'll persist in memory as long as that node process is running
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: it's fast enough even with our massive app so it should be fine
[17:57] drudge: cluster works great
[17:57] tbranyen: methym: node supervisor apparently does this
[17:58] chrisdickinson: anyone have a pure-JS inflate/deflate laying around?
[17:58] drudge: node supervisor is old! cluster is the new hotness
[17:58] tbranyen: are they comparable?
[17:58] KRTac: tbranyen: i'm talking about thousands of stored records simultaniousley on one location
[17:58] methym: tjholowaychuk: ok, great.  I'll grab cluster
[17:58] drudge: tbranyen: cluster does what supervisor did and more
[17:58] tbranyen: seems to me cluster tries to solve a different problem
[17:58] aheckmann: drudge - how so
[17:58] timcosgrove has left the channel
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: cluster is not for reloading, but it does have a reload plugin
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: which basically just does a force restart
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: but it's plenty fast enough
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: no need to try stupid hot swapping of modules etc

[18:22] pcardune has joined the channel
[18:22] isaacs: ben_alman: because it's installed globally, not locally
[18:22] isaacs: ben_alman: global for bins, local for modules.
[18:22] isaacs: if it's used IN your project, install it IN your project.
[18:23] ben_alman: i'm using it in general
[18:23] ben_alman: i don't install node as part of my project

[18:24] isaacs: that IS a super old version of tar.
[18:24] path[l]: is there a recommended simple store :/? Alfred has wierd bugs and nstore doesnt even require 
[18:24] isaacs: the reason i ask is that it's not properly unpacking into that __package.npm folder, and then exiting with 0

[18:29] isaacs: bradleymeck: well, mostly it's lacking some smarts with pax headers when generating files, and it needs test coverage.

[18:31] isaacs: path[l]: it seems to not have one.  bug the author.  `npm owner ls nstore` (pretty sure it's creationix)

[18:34] path[l]: ah I see
[18:34] path[l]: isaacs:  is this because of a change in npm?
[18:35] liquidproof_ has joined the channel
[18:35] isaacs: path[l]: yeah, "main" is required to be able to require() the module now.
[18:35] seegeekrun has joined the channel
[18:36] path[l]: hmm, that suggests that nstore has not been used in a while. Actually my question is, since I havent really been active in the community, is there a preferred simple key value store?

[18:37] path[l]: I need persistence =p.

[19:12] isaacs: zzen: ohhhhh....
[19:12] isaacs: zzen: maybe the mv was slower than the rm or something?
[19:12] isaacs: zzen: or vice versa.  some kind of race
[19:13] isaacs: zzen: because what npm does is this:  1. rm .../package; 2. mv __package.npm/package .../package; 3. rm __package.npm
[19:13] isaacs: zzen: so, if the first rm is too slow, or the second too fast, you could have overlap or something, maybe?
[19:13] isaacs: i dunno
[19:13] zzen: isaacs: that's what I was thinking… it's a ec2 ebs disk
[19:13] isaacs: hm.... still, though, the cb shouldn't fire until it's at least mostly done-ish
[19:13] isaacs: maybe what i ought to do is just not rm the __package.npm foldert.
[19:14] isaacs: i mean, it's empty, it's like, 2 bytes or whatever.
[19:14] zzen: let me try to pace this manually to the end and see it through

[19:19] lola: is there a place where I can see benchmarking comparisons for node.js vs apache/php, etc?
[19:19] ben_alman: isaacs, if i install npm per the github readme, it installs 1.0.1rc7

[19:28] techwraith: lola, Gelegrodan: Using node as a webserver works just fine, handle concurrency almost as well (sometimes just as well) as nginx.
[19:28] Gelegrodan: perezd: depends on what to graph :P

[19:29] Gelegrodan: techwraith: yes maybe its fine, but its not really built specificly for it

[19:32] techwraith: Gelegrodan: For me it's one less moving part to work with. If you can do it without yet another server running, why not?
[19:32] KRTac: wink_: trying it out
[19:32] malkomalko: ahh, my node.js cucumber implementation is almost ready for the world
[19:33] KRTac: wink_: ReferenceError: util is not defined

[19:34] Gelegrodan: techwraith: hm sure, any good php-parser tho?
[19:34] akashiraffee: pietras: ah so you are throwing pause() into a 'data' handler?

[19:35] pietras: akashiraffee: sth like http.createServer(function(req, res){ req.pause })
[19:35] tbranyen: which could reach out to php
[19:36] Gelegrodan: nice..
[19:36] qbert: anyone have ideas on the best logging module, log4js ?
[19:36] techwraith: Gelegrodan: Not sure why PHP is a requirement of a webserver... Write the whole thing in JS :)

[19:38] V1: Anyone! With little knowledge of node's innerworkings:, If i send a "string" to net.Stream is it automagically converted to a Buffer? Or does node sends a it as regular V8 based string?
[19:38] akashiraffee: pietras: what happens?
[19:38] halfhalo: thats what she said
[19:38] Gelegrodan: techwraith: or why not in brainfuck? https://github.com/masylum/node-brainfuck
[19:38] pietras: akashiraffee: it works fine with large files
[19:38] A_Nub: Because then my brain would be fucked.

[19:41] pietras: akashiraffee: like inside req.on('data', {..})? what difference does it make?
[19:42] tmedema: I'm trying to use https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/blob/master/lib/formidable/multipart_parser.js (a multipart parser) in the browser, for which I'd need to use the node.js buffer in the browser, would that be a difficult task?
[19:42] akashiraffee: okay, sorry, it is in there -- I'm new to this too, lol -- but you are right, that req.pause() should not apply to some other req

[19:56] gkatsev: I mean, I'm no master but I spent some time with it yesterday and the day before
[19:56] n2liquid: e.g. my query is { usr: 'n2liquid', pwd: '1234' } but MongoDB is being hit a { query: { usr: 'n2liquid', pwd: '1234' } }
[19:56] johnnywengluu: since i passed 2 arguments to the callback
[19:56] n2liquid: why's that?
[19:56] johnnywengluu: same here=)
[19:56] n2liquid: (the query obviously fails, btw)
[19:57] gkatsev: johnnywengluu: can you even do that?

[20:29] clee: can anybody tell me what causes node to malloc 800 bytes exactly?
[20:29] clee: because it's doing that ... 5 million times in my script
[20:29] A_Nub: cha0s: just require('gzip')
[20:29] clee: and I'm not sure why.
[20:30] A_Nub: clee: allocating buffers?

[20:30] clee: er. wow, way to lose a bunch of chars.
[20:30] clee: does each Buffer require 800 bytes?
[20:31] cha0s: A_Nub, well where is npm installing modules? have you set NODE_PATH?
[20:31] A_Nub: cha0s: nvm was a versioning problem.
[20:31] techwraith: A_Nub: is your NODE_PATH set correctly? Issacs might be able to help

[20:40] cha0s: huxley_spark, By default prefix is /usr/local. /usr will take precedence. I'd uninstall everything in /usr/local and use /usr, but that's just my preference. Either way you should delete all but one to reduce confusion.
[20:41] pyrony: Does node have a reliable mysql driver yet?

[22:55] stillmotion: so there's no way to incrementally include a html file into jsdom?
[22:56] stillmotion: Right now I have to wait about 4 minutes for jsdom to finish parsing it before the callback is invoked.
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: 4 minutes?
[22:56] stillmotion: yes
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: yikes
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: how much markup
[22:56] stillmotion: 35k lines
[22:57] clee: piscisaureus: I honestly have no idea what's going on with my code. I thought it was okay, but apparently I'm allocating 800 bytes 5 almost 6 million times
[22:58] piscisaureus: clee: what code?
[22:58] piscisaureus: (I was offline for a few minus so I might have missed something)
[22:58] clee: piscisaureus: https://gist.github.com/712cbb04668e74600d32
[22:58] stillmotion: fs.readFile is quick to load it into memory, however, jsdom is a slow one on parsing into the window.
[22:58] clee: it's a recursive-descent parser for Apple's binary plist files
[23:00] feedtheaimbot has joined the channel
[23:00] piscisaureus: clee: so how do you know that you are allocating 800 bytes. You know where it happens in that code?
[23:00] clee: I'm using Instruments
[23:01] clee: it says I have 5,958,717 calls to v8::internal::Malloced::New(unsigned long)
[23:01] clee: resulting in a total of 4,521.39MB allocated
[23:01] clee: (this is for parsing a 4MB file.)
[23:01] clee: seems a little excessive.
[23:02] piscisaureus: clee: ah; but I do not think ...::New(unsigned long) allocates space for an unsigned long
[23:03] kmwallio has joined the channel
[23:04] clee: right. under the Statistics view, it says I've got exactly that many allocations of size 800 bytes

[23:06] piscisaureus: clee: so your node ends up actually using that much memory?
[23:06] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[23:07] clee: not all at once.
[23:07] clee: it doesn't appear that I ever have more than *one* of these 800-byte allocations active
[23:07] MikhX has joined the channel
[23:07] clee: but the fact that I'm mallocing it 6 million times is concerning
[23:07] piscisaureus: Well in that case there is not really a problem or is it?

[23:07] clee: well, it's slowing my code down

[23:08] piscisaureus: clee: hmmm.
[23:08] clee: it would go much faster.
[23:08] piscisaureus: clee: likely it is not that simple
[23:08] piscisaureus: you have a stack trace for that?
[23:08] piscisaureus: does Instrument give you one?
[23:09] clee: it doesn't give me the contents of the memory that are being allocated
[23:09] clee: but I think I can get the stack trace...
[23:10] clee: looks like it's being freed by v8::internal::StubCache::ComputeLoadField(v8::internal::String*, v8::internal::JSObject*, v8::internal::JSObject*, int)
[23:10] clee: ACTION looks at StubCache

[23:21] piscisaureus: clee: er, so how did you get the other stack trace then. Also, what is require('binary')?

[23:22] PhilK: isaacs: search and publish work fine through apache, but install is failing at the download
[23:22] isaacs: PhilK: what i mean is, is the apache host the --registry or the --proxy
[23:22] PhilK: registry

[23:24] isaacs: kewl, so, it seems like the solution to GH-804 is for fetch() to send auth when it's fetching to the registry and --always-auth is on.
[23:24] isaacs: that seems relatively straightforward.
[23:24] isaacs: if a bit inelegant

[23:25] PhilK: yeah, I've been poking around with node for awhile just never really dug in
[23:25] pquerna: you said you liked ruby, its all the same right
[23:25] isaacs: the thing about JavaScript is that it's really not worth not liking it.

[23:26] Nexxy: I'm okay with comparing js to ruby until it comes to the community... please don't be like the ruby community.

[23:28] marcello3d: I use it, too, doesn't mean I like it :)
[23:28] jonaslund: isaacs: lots of embedded people are quite fine without ms, java or js :)
[23:28] clee: oh hey
[23:28] isaacs: jonaslund: and their stuff *never* touches the web?  srsly?
[23:28] clee: SubStack: didn't you write the node-binary module?
[23:28] marcello3d: isaacs: does a microwave touch the web? D:

[23:29] marcello3d: http://pow.cx/ <- anyone know how hard it'd be to make a node.js version of this?

[23:30] isaacs: jonaslund: sure, but i mean, even if you were hiring someone to write device drivers for embedded systems that live way underneath the kernel, how does someone live today, and be a nerd, and not *ever* touch js?
[23:30] clee: SubStack: actually I have no idea if it's your fault or not but I built something using your code and the performance is kind of awful
[23:31] isaacs: monokrome: no, node does not have coroutines.
[23:31] monokrome: hmm
[23:31] isaacs: monokrome: it has very sophisticated subprocess management utilites.
[23:31] clee: SubStack: https://gist.github.com/712cbb04668e74600d32
[23:31] monokrome: yeah
[23:31] SubStack: quite possible
[23:31] marcello3d: oh boy, binary plists
[23:31] marcello3d: good luck with that
[23:31] clee: marcello3d: it works, it's just slow
[23:32] clee: oh, and doubles don't work yet.
[23:32] marcello3d: can you write it in c?

[23:32] Levi has joined the channel
[23:32] jonaslund: isaacs: well if someone has plenty of experience with embedded stuff they'll prolly keep working in the field until they die of old age
[23:32] clee: isaacs: why?
[23:32] SubStack: clee: just use binary's stream processing
[23:32] isaacs: clee: because you care about performance :)
[23:32] jonaslund: that's people
[23:32] SubStack: then you don't need to keep everything in memory
[23:32] marcello3d: jonaslund: isaacs is just trolling, don't mind him ;)
[23:32] SubStack: and you don't need to write icky switch/case statements
[23:32] sstephenson: marcello3d: pow is a node app
[23:32] n2liquid: in connect's session middleware, what's the purpose of the "secret" configuration entry?
[23:32] clee: SubStack: I can't parse it as a stream.
[23:32] SubStack: cripes everybody uses binary wrong and it makes me sad :(
[23:32] clee: it's a recursive format.
[23:32] isaacs: jonaslund: so... not everyone uses JavaScript.  But, given a few more decades, everyone still alive WILL know JavaScript?
[23:32] n2liquid: I know it's used to compute some hash, but what hash is this?
[23:32] marcello3d: sstephenson: you're shitting me D:
[23:33] n2liquid: just curious
[23:33] marcello3d: is it coffeescript?
[23:33] sstephenson: marcello3d: i'd like to add support for serving node stuff, but right now it only does rack
[23:33] clee: marcello3d: yeah, it's coffeescript + node.js
[23:33] marcello3d: haha
[23:33] marcello3d: that's awesome
[23:33] jonaslund: isaacs: possibly.. possibly not, i'm not an oracle
[23:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:33] sstephenson: marcello3d: http://pow.cx/docs/
[23:34] marcello3d: sstephenson: yea I was looking at that, but I don't know enough ruby/coffeescript to recognize that 
[23:34] piscisaureus: jonaslund, this is the java age, you should be on oracle
[23:34] clee: SubStack: specifically, you can't start reading objects until you've read the trailer in the last 32 bytes of the file, and then you have to parse the offset table
[23:34] SubStack: clee: you can absolutely write recursive streaming parsers using binary, you just have to start out writing it the right way
[23:34] SubStack: oh trails bah
[23:34] isaacs: sstephenson: powcx is your thing?
[23:34] jonaslund: piscisaureus: *drumroll*
[23:34] sstephenson: isaacs: yeah
[23:34] isaacs: sstephenson: seems pretty nifty :)
[23:34] sstephenson: trying to infect the rubyists
[23:34] jonaslund: piscisaureus: did you get anything out of my patches ?
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: please dont lol
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: we dont need more CS
[23:34] piscisaureus: jonaslund: well I applied them
[23:34] piscisaureus: :-)
[23:34] isaacs: sstephenson: lmk if you ever wanna build something like that for node.  there's probably some ways that npm and nave/nvm could be quite handy there.
[23:34] piscisaureus: Did not finish yet
[23:35] marcello3d: sstephenson: so it's basically an automatic proxy?
[23:35] clee: SubStack: if you can make it faster/better/more correct, by all means! please do.
[23:35] steveklabnik: ow looks really cool
[23:35] piscisaureus: I guess it saved me some headaches :-p
[23:35] steveklabnik: pow
[23:35] clee: this is my first node.js experiment, as well.
[23:35] clee: so I'm open to suggestions.
[23:35] jonaslund: piscisaureus: manually i presume? that diff was taken from a january era source-set
[23:35] ngs has joined the channel
[23:35] isaacs: clee: I've heard that const will cause v8 to run significantly slower.  it also has a lot of really oddball effects.  (like, you can't shadow consts with a "var" in a nested scope)
[23:36] piscisaureus: jonaslund: my node is pretty old as well. No so much has happened actually
[23:36] marcello3d: sstephenson: I like the art on the site
[23:36] piscisaureus: tortoisediff didn't complain
[23:36] marcello3d: isaacs: what's the point of const, then?
[23:36] SubStack: clee: perhaps a 2-pass procedure where you first seek to the end and read off the trailing data and the table and then you open the rest of the file as a stream and parse it incrementally?
[23:36] isaacs: marcello3d: i dunno.  const is a dick.
[23:36] marcello3d: when was const added to js?
[23:37] isaacs: es5-ish, i believe
[23:37] isaacs: it's pretty recent
[23:37] marcello3d: oh ok
[23:37] clee: SubStack: I don't think that'll work... I need random access.
[23:37] marcello3d: so basically you can't use it client-side
[23:37] isaacs: but, like, this fails:  const FOO="bar"; (function () { var FOO = 1 })()
[23:37] isaacs: which is dumb
[23:37] marcello3d: that is pretty dumb
[23:37] isaacs: marcello3d: right, except in ffx, chrome, or webkit
[23:38] isaacs: the idea is that a const should be this powerful immutable way to define a symbol that can never ever be anything other than what it is.
[23:38] piscisaureus: clee: what you need random access for, apart from reading the trailer
[23:38] piscisaureus: ?
[23:38] clee: to read a dictionary, you read 1 marker byte that says "a dictionary follows"; then a set of ints which are indexes into the offset table for keys, and another set of indexes into the offset table for values
[23:38] isaacs: but in practice, it's hard to optimize and has awkward effects.
[23:38] marcello3d: sstephenson: does pow.cx deal with automatic code reloading?
[23:38] clee: so to look up a key, you need to read the int for the key's offset, then look in the offset table to find the offset at that index
[23:39] sstephenson: marcello3d: no, it defers to the app, but you can touch tmp/restart.txt to have it reload on the next request
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: pos makes it so easy, all you have to do is install compile node first for your ruby apps :p
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: pow*
[23:39] sstephenson: tjholowaychuk: i ship a binary actually
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: ah :)
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: I was wondering :p seemed to be leaving something out there

[23:45] piscisaureus: clee: like meaningless bytes
[23:46] clee: it's possible
[23:46] clee: all of the tools I'm aware of generate files without padding bytes, but the spec allows for them
[23:48] stillmotion has joined the channel
[23:48] clee: isaacs: for the record, replacing 'const' with 'val' had zero effect on performance
[23:48] stillmotion: is there a verbose debug option for jsdom to see what it's parsing?
[23:48] isaacs: clee: that's a shame :)
[23:49] clee: I was hoping it would be something that simple :/
[23:49] piscisaureus: clee: looking at the spec it is very well possible to parse it serially. You just cannot construct the tree bottom-up.
[23:49] isaacs: clee: sure, it's good to grab at the low-hanging fruit first, but i guess that wasn't the culprit :)
[23:49] marcello3d: the demoscene is like the nerd version of tagging
[23:49] isaacs: or the v8 team made it not slow when i wasn't looking :)
[23:49] isaacs: clee: you should run it through the profiler with node --prof
[23:49] clee: piscisaureus: are you sure? because you have to look up the offsets for keys and values from the offset table.
[23:50] jonaslund: marcello3d: of tagging?
[23:50] marcello3d: yea
[23:50] clee: (it would have been too easy to encode the offsets for keys and values directly.
[23:50] clee: )
[23:50] isaacs: clee: oh, you're doing random file access?
[23:50] clee: isaacs: yes.
[23:50] isaacs: that'll potentially spin the disk back and forth then?
[23:50] jonaslund: marcello3d: not really sure i follow you here :)
[23:50] clee: we're talking a 4MB file.
[23:51] clee: it's entirely cached in RAM.
[23:51] marcello3d: jonaslund: ya know, like graffiti
[23:51] isaacs: oh, ok
[23:51] jonaslund: oh grafitti
[23:51] jonaslund: interesting analogy
[23:51] marcello3d: graffiti :)
[23:52] marcello3d: I have mixed feelings about demoscene
[23:52] jonaslund: how come ?
[23:52] marcello3d: I think it's cool as art, but I kinda wish they made interactive stuff/games with their skills
[23:52] piscisaureus: clee: well. Do it however you want. But if Substack says you are using the binary parser wrong, it is probably true (and Buffer allocations could very well explain those 800-byte mallocs). So you need to either try parsing serially or find another soluton for decoding binary values.
[23:52] jonaslund: err
[23:53] jonaslund: marcello3d: take a wild guess what many of the active people do for a day job :D
[23:53] marcello3d: fair 'nuff :)

[23:53] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[23:53] SubStack: multi-pass will probably do the trick
[23:53] clee: the only way to construct these objects is bottom-up
[23:53] clee: unless there's something I'm missing.
[23:54] SubStack: clee: just do a pass to collect the offsets then another pass to map the offsets to values
[23:54] SubStack: you can do those both serially
[23:54] marcello3d: clee: I'm pretty sure you can do it in one pass
[23:54] marcello3d: without loading the whole thing
[23:54] marcello3d: apple wouldn't have made it not support that

[23:56] SubStack: write a c++ node binding for it then?
