[01:42] webbower: isaacs: I'll try that out if the port maintainer doesn't fix it soon
[01:43] isaacs: webbower: ask them why they're running `make docs` when the docs are already up to date in the release package.  (or, if they're not getting the release package from registry.npmjs.org, why not?)
[01:43] monokrome: isaacs: Are there any tricks you've come across for putting non-global executable files into the PATH? I tried adding ./node_modules/*/bin but that obviously doesn't work.

[01:56] isaacs: monokrome: like that^
[01:57] isaacs: monokrome: then you can run `npm start` in the root of the project to run the local coffee script, and installing your app will run `cake build` first, and tests will use the local vows, etc.

[02:30] isaacs: zemanel: you can't
[02:30] isaacs: zemanel: just pass objects back and forth
[02:30] isaacs: var b = require("b");  b.decorate(myObject);  myObject.thingFromB()
[02:30] zemanel: i see
[02:30] isaacs: or at least, that'd be one way to do it
[02:30] isaacs: there's not really a "the" way, since the language is so flexible
[02:31] zemanel: the question is sillier than that
[02:31] zemanel: what i want exactly is to share a configuration dict across modules
[02:31] akujin- has joined the channel
[02:31] isaacs: var c = require("./config.js")
[02:31] isaacs: do that in all the modules.

[02:33] hacksparrow has joined the channel
[02:33] isaacs: well... you can't get at the function scope from outside of it.
[02:33] zemanel: very early stage
[02:33] isaacs: yeah.  i'd recommend that you do a different thing.
[02:33] zemanel: atm it works by the dev doing "require "cakery/recipes/hello_world" on his Cakefile
[02:33] isaacs: just export functions, and let your caller handle it
[02:33] zemanel: yeah that works
[02:34] isaacs: zemanel: hello = require("cakery/recipes/hello_world") <-- what's wrong with that?
[02:34] zemanel: because a recipe is 1 or more tasks
[02:34] arg0s has joined the channel
[02:34] isaacs: right
[02:34] isaacs: (not getting it, i guess)
[02:34] zemanel: https://github.com/zemanel/node-cakery/blob/master/src/cakery/recipes/hello_world.coffee
[02:34] zemanel: it basically includes the recipe functions on the dev Cakefile
[02:34] isaacs: hm... this language confuses me.
[02:35] zemanel: no worries its all js
[02:35] isaacs: can you express that in javascript?
[02:35] zemanel: ca Cakefile is a js file
[02:35] isaacs: i mean https://github.com/zemanel/node-cakery/blob/master/src/cakery/recipes/hello_world.coffee
[02:35] zemanel: with functions, "task('foobar')
[02:35] isaacs: is task a function, then?
[02:35] zemanel: yes
[02:35] isaacs: why not just export it?
[02:36] isaacs: oh, are you calling the function?  or defining it?
[02:36] zemanel: a cakefile is just a js file with Task() functions
[02:37] zemanel: pretty much like fabric
[02:37] zemanel: (dunno if you know what it is
[02:37] isaacs: the only .akefiles i know are Makefiles
[02:37] zemanel: yeah like a Makefile
[02:37] isaacs: but... this isn't in make syntax.
[02:37] isaacs: you're not defining a target and the things it depends on, and then zero or more shell commands
[02:37] zemanel: its in coffeescript sintax
[02:38] zemanel: you can define a task like 'task "cakery:recipe:compile"'
[02:38] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:38] isaacs: is that a function call?
[02:38] zemanel: and call $cake cakery:recipe:compile

[02:38] isaacs: like task("cakery:recipe:compile")?
[02:38] tim_smart: isaacs: https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/cake.coffee

[02:39] nerdy_ has joined the channel
[02:39] isaacs: i find it disastrously confusing to look at.
[02:39] zemanel: heh :-)
[02:39] zemanel: anyway its a file of functions
[02:39] isaacs: so, you want your module to be "inlined" in another module, then?
[02:40] isaacs: so that you can call task() in there, instead of in your module?
[02:40] tim_smart: isaacs: Basically it extends the global object with task, invoke and option methods.
[02:40] zemanel: no
[02:40] isaacs: zemanel: i'm completely not grokking what it is you're trying to do

[02:41] isaacs: "adds those functions to the 1st"

[02:41] zemanel: because when you run $cake
[02:41] isaacs: it calls functions?
[02:41] heavysixer has joined the channel
[02:41] isaacs: or it adds stuff into the scope of the original cakefile module?

[02:44] isaacs: dominictarr: SLEEP
[02:44] isaacs: dominictarr: like REST
[02:44] zemanel: isaacs: so, if on an empty Cakefile, i add 'require "cakery/recipes/hello_world"'
[02:44] dominictarr: but better!
[02:44] isaacs: right!
[02:44] zemanel: it will add the hello_world functs to the cakefile, hence the 'recipes' thing
[02:45] dominictarr: 'cos that is what your servers will be doing
[02:45] isaacs: zemanel: well, it'll call "task" in that other module, yeahj.
[02:45] zemanel: so i can create common tasks, that are useful across projects, like building, cleaning, etc 
[02:45] zemanel: tha tcan be shared with the community
[02:45] zemanel: prety much like Homebrew doees

[02:48] zemanel: what i want is to create a dict config that an be accessible from the Cakefiles and other modules
[02:48] tim_smart: zemanel: require('cakery').bake('hello_world') or something?
[02:48] zemanel: that was about replacing the inlining approach
[02:49] zemanel: i was looking into something like
[02:49] zemanel: var cakery = require('cakery')
[02:49] tim_smart: Does require('module_name/submodule') work?
[02:49] zemanel: cakery.set("someconfig", "some value")
[02:49] zemanel: which is easy
[02:50] isaacs: tim_smart: sure.
[02:50] isaacs: tim_smart: the require('foo') just maps to a folder named 'foo'
[02:50] isaacs: so you can dive right in there
[02:50] isaacs: require("npm/lib/install")
[02:50] tim_smart: isaacs: node_modules/module/submodule/index.js?
[02:51] panfist: 2

[04:37] andoriyu: davidbanham, I solved problem very brute way — no public routes :) but thx anyway
[04:38] davidbanham: So you've installed it into whatever directory you happened to be in at the time. This is the preferred behaviour for most npm modules, because it means you can have different versions of packages etc for different apps you're working on. I don't use Forever, but I'm guessing (maybe wrongly) that it's like nodemon in that it makes more sense to install it globally.
[04:38] andoriyu: hmm, what about digest auth...

[07:35] dexter_e: Anyone know how to limit the  use(static)  to only match files in one route?
[07:36] dexter_e: basically prevent static file lookups for everything except /static/
[07:36] Emmanuel: do you guys know of a web crawler that interprets JS ?
[07:37] AAA_awright: Like Googlebot?
[07:37] Emmanuel: I'm suppose to scrap a website who was generated to avoid SEO
[07:37] Emmanuel: (I'm not kidding)
[07:37] Emmanuel: all the links are javascript string, concatenated then ducoment.written
[07:37] Emmanuel: AAA_awright: maybe
[07:37] AAA_awright: Googlebot does run scripts on pages
[07:37] Emmanuel: so basically I want something that get the page, built the DOM by executing the JS

[07:38] Emmanuel_ has joined the channel
[07:38] Emmanuel_: d'oh
[07:38] dexter_e: Emmanuel: JSDOM+Jquery works great
[07:38] Emmanuel_: yeah, but I'll have to write it :)
[07:39] dexter_e: Well, you'll have to know what you're looking for
[07:39] dexter_e: It will be easy to snapshot the state of the page

[07:45] _kud has joined the channel
[07:45] Emmanuel`: don't even need jquery I think

[08:43] mikola: for example, I have a process which is acting as a gateway, and a number of worker processes

[08:44] mikola: though perhaps this is not an amazingly great idea

[08:46] necrodearia has joined the channel
[08:46] mikola: due to copying data through the center node twice
[08:47] mikola: also passing the interface between the two dnode processes would be a bit annoying

[08:47] mikola: the main issue actually is figuring out how to get the RPC stuff to show up on the server on the other side of the router, if that makes any sense

[10:59] weepy: hi - I want to stream a file that's being written live. E.g. a bit like tail -f 
[11:00] weepy: the trouble is that once the read stream gets to the end - it emits an "end" event and no more reads happen
[11:00] weepy: anyone know how to get around this ?
[11:00] pen_ has joined the channel
[11:02] netlemur_: weepy, you have to watch the file for changes
[11:03] weepy: thanks netlemur_ , so fs.watchFile( "", -) 
[11:04] netlemur_: weepy, https://github.com/cloudkick/cast/blob/develop/lib/util/tail.js perhaps that helps
[11:04] secoif has joined the channel
[11:04] chjj: weepy: yeah you could do that, it will get a little more complicated because youll want to open the file and directly read the last few bytes that were written
[11:05] netlemur_: I use that for a monitoring app that reads logfiles and outputs graphs
[11:05] netlemur_: in realtime
[11:05] weepy: aah sweet
[11:05] weepy: im generating audio
[11:05] weepy: and i want to stream it in real time to an audiotag
[11:05] weepy: right now it's appending to a tmp.wav file
[11:05] netlemur_: oh. don't know anything about audio :-)
[11:06] weepy: it's basically the same
[11:06] netlemur_: what's writing into the file? sounds interesting
[11:07] weepy: ive written a little audio processing language in C++ and Lua
[11:07] weepy: so im running it as a child process to a node server
[11:08] weepy: then im streaming the audio back to the client

[11:13] jtsnow has joined the channel
[11:14] weepy: Glenjamin: yes - stout is a file essentially - why do you ask ?
[11:18] Glenjamin: if you had the C++ process pipe the data over stdout, you wouldn't get an end event unless you closed the stream
[11:19] Glenjamin: the problems you're having seem to be because of the file as an intermediary

[11:19] weepy: oh i see

[15:07] benperth: I have a list of around about 100 users, which needs to be sorted based on their points... Would it be best to do this on the server and push the result to all users, or is it wiser to push the raw data to the clients and have it sorted on the client side?
[15:07] joshkehn: 100 users? 
[15:07] benperth: 100 players in a game
[15:07] joshkehn: That's easy to do client side.
[15:08] blueadept: as a side note though, anyone know why npm install validator is failing?
[15:08] joshkehn: blueadept: What does npm say?

[15:43] blup: well, i'm wondering whether i have to make a company to make ad profit, and eventually premium memberships
[15:44] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: it's on the list of todo's - it needs to be a libuv patch though
[15:44] jetienne: blup: ah ok this is about business model ? yep this channel may not be the most suitable. try #startups

[15:53] cclever: no, javascript
[15:53] context: ...
[15:54] context: no you said php.
[15:54] kevwil_ has joined the channel

[15:54] knifed has joined the channel
[15:54] daveo: I cloned the git directory, should i have cloned specific branch or something?

[15:55] bEEEviz: i have: var geolib = require('./geolib.js'); which works fine
[15:55] context: cclever: yes. you need to ask the 'php people' how the fuck the session is serialized. THEN you will have a better idea on how to de-serialize it.
[15:56] motill has joined the channel
[15:56] bEEEviz: when i console.log(geolib) all methods and properties are shown correctly
[15:56] bEEEviz: but when i try to call a function using geolib.getDistance
[15:56] TheJH: cclever, you could at least give us an example of serialized stuff from php...
[15:56] context: daveo: you're asking the "node people" how do deal with your craptastic "php data"
[15:56] bEEEviz: my nodejs output says "undefined"
[15:56] context: err, cclever 
[15:56] bnoordhuis: daveo: libuv is bundled with node. can you gist the build log?

[15:59] TheJH: guy, well, there's your fault - you shouldn't use the latest master
[15:59] guy: ok.. all I did, was git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
[15:59] DrMcKay: guy: no no
[15:59] DrMcKay: guy: it's simple
[16:00] DrMcKay: guy: node-waf got changed at some point
[16:00] tbranyen: its also simple to fix the installation instructions as to not confuse every single person who is new to node
[16:00] DrMcKay: guy: give me a sec
[16:00] tbranyen: =(
[16:00] TheJH: guy, then do "git checkout v0.5.v0.5.7"
[16:00] tbranyen: TheJH: was node-waf removed?
[16:00] guy: ACTION waiting for what DrMcKay has to say
[16:00] TheJH: err, whoops
[16:00] DrMcKay: guy: also, do what TheJH says
[16:00] TheJH: guy, "git checkout v0.5.7" after you cloned
[16:00] DrMcKay: guy: wait, I'm looking on how I've fixed it
[16:01] guy: ok. though, first of all: I should delete everything I've already installed, right?
[16:01] context: do any of these people have an excuse for running -pre ?
[16:01] DrMcKay: guy: no
[16:01] DrMcKay: context: I do, but I don't
[16:02] bnoordhuis: i do and i do
[16:02] DrMcKay: though I 
[16:02] DrMcKay: though I do have it easily accessible

[16:04] rpeterson1: bnoordhuis: spoke too soon, just failed with same error again

[16:08] daveo: ok, thanks I'll try that

[16:08] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[16:09] guy: context: what?
[16:09] DrMcKay: I think it's some primal fear humanship developed at the early ages.
[16:09] bnoordhuis: guy: 0.4.x is stable, 0.5.x is unstable a.k.a. dev
[16:09] rpeterson1: bnoordhius: https://gist.github.com/597191888e9d8ce680b3
[16:09] guy: so, should I use 0.4.7?
[16:09] guy: so, should I use 0.4.12*
[16:09] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: i like force push, i remember svn and its indestructible commits
[16:09] bnoordhuis: guy: if you want stable, yes

[16:10] davididas has joined the channel
[16:10] Glenjamin: there's a few things in 0.5.x which aren't in 0.4.x, but in general stuff seems to break
[16:10] rpeterson1: bnoordhius: this actually looks like a different issue now, hmm
[16:10] bnoordhuis: guy: you won't be one of the cool kids
[16:10] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: I like that git allows you to do so. git filter-branch saved my ass once. but there's something bad in it.
[16:11] bnoordhuis: guy: but you won't have to deal with mysterious failures either :)
[16:11] DrMcKay: but again, it may get you raptors.
[16:11] bnoordhuis: rpeterson1: yes, that really can't happen
[16:11] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: no, only goto does that
[16:11] bnoordhuis: rpeterson1: is that a 0.4.12 from source tarball?
[16:12] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: so `git push -f` gets you sharks?

[17:01] jkridner: hi all, I work on the beagleboard project (which currently runs node.js and Cloud9 IDE) but I want to extend node.js to have more general ioctl and/or syscall support.
[17:02] AaronMT has joined the channel
[17:02] jkridner: I want to do that because I believe the closure model for node.js could be very friendly for embedded system development, but we need to do more than just read/write handles to talk to device drivers.

[17:03] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[17:03] Nuck: ACTION just wants Node.js on embedded devices

[17:04] Nuck: hmm
[17:04] rpeterson1: bnoordhuis: nope, build 0.5.7 resulted in same error

[17:07] Nuck: (and by that I mean I had to look up ioctl to check that it meant what I thought it did)
[17:07] random123: Glenjamin, I think if it comes down to writing something that works in a straight foward way instead of writing some mystifying algorithm, straight forward has way more utility, I think PHP's success can attest to that
[17:07] Skola has joined the channel

[17:20] freeformz has joined the channel
[17:20] junkee[]: junkee[]: I like the concept. But i would just make the function call async if the last parameter is a function
[17:20] creationix: junkee[]: so I think bergie's latest comment makes sense
[17:20] Morkel has joined the channel
[17:20] creationix: junkee[]: that works too, but it's a little more magical for a public API
[17:20] creationix: junkee[]: but then again, this is already pretty magical ffi stuff, so it fits
[17:21] creationix: i wish the gi repository had annotations about if a function did disk or network I/O
[17:21] junkee[]: creationix: okay, nice. I just asked the people in introspection about it
[17:21] junkee[]: no response yet :/
[17:22] creationix: I wouldn't expect it, I don't know of any event-loop based systems using gir
[17:22] ako has joined the channel
[17:22] creationix: they are all old-school style interfaces with blocking I/O and threads for concurrency
[17:22] junkee[]: btw, do you think that locking a mutex should be async, too? I'm just wondering
[17:22] creationix: junkee[]: how would you make it async
[17:23] creationix: eio_custom uses a thread pool which itself has a mutex lock
[17:23] JSManiacs has joined the channel
[17:23] Lemon|mbp has joined the channel
[17:23] junkee[]: o.0
[17:23] creationix: it depends on what's it waiting for

[17:25] Twisol has joined the channel
[17:25] creationix: there are events from the high-performance select multiplexer, this is things like network sockets and other sockets
[17:25] creationix: then there are timer events, that may also be in the same multiplexer
[17:26] murvin has joined the channel
[17:26] creationix: there is process.nextTick, which is just an event loop hack that simulates a new event by having access to the event loop
[17:26] creationix: then there is the thread pool that makes otherwise blocking functions async
[17:26] creationix: it's used for the filesystem in node
[17:27] creationix: I'm pretty sure gir bindings would only be able to use the thread pool to make things async
[17:27] junkee[]: right. and we only need to care about file and network io
[17:28] creationix: but sadly, even network I/O won't be able to integrate with the multiplexer
[17:28] creationix: gir won't give enough information to make that happen
[17:28] Twisol: I have some binary network data in a Buffer, representing characters from a specific codepage. What's the best way to translate from the binary data to a UTF-8 string? For example, 0xFF would need to become U+00A0.

[17:30] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[17:30] junkee[]: *same
[17:31] creationix: junkee[]: well, if he wants to use gnome's network stack, that's fine.  node can work as a blocking system.  You just have to understand that node's network stack or timers won't work after that
[17:31] blueadept: anyone know a better way of writing this? http://pastie.org/private/gdqfgzewodlysuqxvktiq
[17:31] creationix: or we can wrap the network stack in the node thread-pool, but it's going to perform pretty badly
[17:31] creationix: which may be ok
[17:32] creationix: how about make the bindings as generic as possible, and there can be both node-gir and vanilla v8-gir
[17:32] mjr_ has joined the channel

[18:14] isaacs: but email is fine, too
[18:15] isaacs: so, the latest is usually what you want.  if you run the install script, it'll download the latest version of npm.
[18:15] isaacs: if you have the git repo, you can run `make install`, and it'll pull down the submodules and then install npm
[18:16] isaacs: if you've downloaded a tarball from github, sorry, it's broken.  dont' do that.
[18:16] guy: ok. that's easy 
[18:16] guy: I did that few times though, but. it simply doesn't work.

[18:40] Brandon_R: Not much
[18:40] Brandon_R: I wonder why someone doesn't make a textmate port for Linux
[18:40] Brandon_R: Seems like a simple program
[18:41] DrMcKay: jarek: it's hard to achieve, I'm not sure if there are proper bindings for DE
[18:41] joshkehn: Because Sublime already exists?

[18:43] blax: it throws exception when memcached client isn't listening
[18:43] jarek: I don't understand why no one is using it for this purpose

[19:13] joshkehn: Plus you can get an external one. IIRC
[19:13] DrMcKay: joshkehn: well, I use it on daily basis
[19:13] joshkehn: I can't remember the last time I used my ethernet port. 
[19:13] joshkehn: Then don't get an Air.
[19:13] joshkehn: Apple is very cut and dry in terms of product selection.
[19:14] DrMcKay: joshkehn: yeah, I think I will get MBP. lack of ethernet just doesn't feel right
[19:14] joshkehn: MBP's are great.
[19:14] joshkehn: But I wouldn't get a 13"
[19:14] DrMcKay: joshkehn: why?
[19:14] joshkehn: I think the 15" is the best of that line.
[19:15] DrMcKay: joshkehn: I need portability, I don't think 15" is portable enough
[19:15] joshkehn: It's a minor cost for a large upgrade.
[19:15] joshkehn: Jump ti the i7's
[19:15] cjm has joined the channel
[19:15] joshkehn: Better graphics.
[19:15] DrMcKay: joshkehn: 13" has i7
[19:15] joshkehn: Only if you bump it. The 15's have it by default.
[19:16] joshkehn: And they only have the dual core.
[19:16] DrMcKay: joshkehn: no, it's by default
[19:16] joshkehn: Let me check on that.
[19:16] joshkehn: The 2.3 has an i5
[19:16] joshkehn: The 2.7 has an i7
[19:16] DrMcKay: joshkehn: and yes, number of cores differs
[19:16] blax: `3rdEden: sorry, that was false alarm, error seems to be somewhere else. thanks though for pointing me in the right direction! ;)

[19:16] `3rdEden: :D! good to know
[19:16] joshkehn: For an extra $300 you get much better graphics, plus a quad i7
[19:16] joshkehn: I find my 15" very portable. 
[19:17] heavysixer has joined the channel
[19:17] DrMcKay: I've had that neat formula for calculating screen width somewhere...
[19:18] joshkehn: Plus the 15" has the antiglare screen.
[19:18] joshkehn: Which really rocks.
[19:19] DrMcKay: oh. it may get useful.
[19:19] joshkehn: You can also stick a 7200 drive in there, if you aren't going the SSD route.
[19:20] blax: go for seagate momentus xt!
[19:20] blax: i'm using it in my 15'' mbp and it's awesome for it's price

[19:29] jarek_: DrMcKay: Fedora seems to be beta-quality distro, they are putting to much bleeding-edge stuff into it

[19:30] joshkehn: Can't do links it seems.
[19:30] joshkehn: [fun with yum](1)
[19:30] joshkehn: It requires Python 2.4 and dislikes you trying to upgrade
[19:31] jesusabdullah: That's pretty typical iirc
[19:31] jesusabdullah: not necessarily with 2.4
[19:31] bnoordhuis: that's true for debian based systems too, though
[19:31] jesusabdullah: but with stale python versions being required on "stable" OS's
[19:31] bnoordhuis: upgrading the system python is a recipe for pain
[19:31] DrMcKay: Fedora 15 does fine with 2.7
[19:31] DrMcKay: and with 3.2
[19:31] jesusabdullah: Well yeah, because they bothered to upgrade F15
[19:31] jesusabdullah: it's not the "stable" branch yo
[19:31] joshkehn: DrMcKay: That's because they upgraded it. It's not mainline though.
[19:31] chapel: bnoordhuis: have you played with the new v8 gc that landed in bleeding edge?

[19:38] tjholowaychuk: AvianFlu there are times for it
[19:38] Daegalus: AvianFlu: An app for storing/sharing recipes online. I am planning to write one for my family's recipes, was wondering if anyoen would be interested in me open-sourcing it
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: rendering client only is very wrong at times
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: depends on the case
[19:39] joshkehn: jade, haml, all the same.
[19:39] AvianFlu: Daegalus, that sounds cool
[19:39] joshkehn: I really hate them.
[19:39] Aikar: wait, so youd rather output some json blob and render the entire ui fully through JS? lol
[19:39] AvianFlu: tjholowaychuk, I agree, no one view is right all the time, on most subjects
[19:39] Daegalus: I like jade, I am using it for my Forum Software, but I am also using caching so unless something changes, the HTML generated from teh Jade is cached
[19:39] Fabryz: joshkehn yep. It's starting to be REALLY frustrating
[19:39] jetienne has joined the channel
[19:40] joshkehn: Aikar: No, I would rather do my HTML markup with something designed to work with HTML.

[19:40] hornairs: thanks chapel
[19:40] Aikar: joshkehn: ah ok, the way you said it sounded like you dont want any html dynamically generated based on server logic
[19:40] joshkehn: But personally? Don't use Node to serve dynanic HTML.
[19:41] joshkehn: Use node for what node is really good at.
[19:41] chapel: hornairs: ?
[19:41] joshkehn: And templating HTML it is not
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: lol
[19:41] Fabryz: tjholowaychuk it's just a <p> BLABLA hey go here <a href="blabla" title="NOPE">lawl</a></p> that doesn't want to work
[19:41] tilgovi: dscape: I really want someone to show me where I'm wrong with that answer, but I think you _need_ fibers (or similar)
[19:42] hornairs: chapel for your response above...? i still cant find an easy way to splice out a node but i think i can figure out itou
[19:42] Aikar: templating engines arnt really specific "node", its "javascript", and templating engines are meant to be an easier to work with method of writing html instead of string concatenation, since it doesnt have open/close style syntax like PHP :P
[19:42] chapel: oh hornairs
[19:42] chapel: sorry, too many channels
[19:43] Aikar: now templating engines making common stuff hard or limiting you on doing what you want yeah is
[19:43] Aikar: wrong
[19:43] aho: the purpose of templating is to separate your business logic from your markup
[19:43] aho: hardcoded markup is f-ing horrible to deal with
[19:43] joshkehn:  Aikar: IIRC erb's follow a similar syntax. I haven't worked with rails in a while.
[19:43] chapel: hornairs: my uneducated guess is using something like this if (node.name === 'num') node.wrap('Math.PI / %s');
[19:43] Aikar: aho: you can do that w/o a template engine by writing the HTML yourself... TEs give you a more cleaner approach to writing that html
[19:43] pgherveo_: Hello there, when I exec npm list I see some green extraneous in front of some package, what deos it mean exactly, should I do something about it ?
[19:44] chapel: you could look for the node you want, and then wrap it in a no execute function
[19:44] joshkehn: aho: Which is why IMO everything should be an API with a HTML wrapper. ;)
[19:44] chapel: or maybe even take it out
[19:44] Aikar: joshkehn: EJS does too

[19:45] Fabryz: pgherveo_ are you using a package.json?
[19:45] tbranyen: writing template engines rules
[19:45] aho: imo a template engine should be very restrictive
[19:45] jbpros has joined the channel
[19:45] tbranyen: aho: urgh i disagree
[19:45] joshkehn: aho: Ala Django?
[19:45] Daegalus: Fabryz: try doing an newline with indent. so like "p <nl, indent> a(href=blah)
[19:45] tbranyen: restrictive syntax, powerful extensions
[19:45] Fabryz: pgherveo_ if so you are using modules under node_modules that are not listed in the package.json
[19:45] aho: ala most template engines :)
[19:45] pgherveo_: yes i do
[19:46] Daegalus: Fabryz: i found that you cant use 2 tags on one line. it jsut doesnt work.
[19:46] tbranyen: 4/20 write template engines errrrday
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: fighting about templates is such a retarded thing, they all suck, hence why we have so many
[19:46] joshkehn: tjholowaychuk: Hah. Good point.
[19:46] pgherveo_: oj so I should list all my package in the package.json ?

[19:47] Fabryz: guess I indented wrokgly
[19:49] Fabryz: what do you suggest to use for js minification/caching for express? something other than minj
[19:49] tbranyen: Aikar: ah your templating is more HAMLy
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: Fabryz i use uglifyjs
[19:49] tbranyen: i use mine general purpose
[19:49] Aikar: I designed nova to be a TRUE javascript syntax engine. not JSON, but actual JS code. so you can dynamically control everything. wanna throw up a quick test page/prototype? put your code right in the middle of the template, even async db calls and such. IDC i'm not limiting you. its your choice to keep your presentation seperate from logic or not
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: Fabryz i dont love it but it works
[19:50] tbranyen: uglify-js hides too much in its executable
[19:50] pgherveo_: Fabryz: Have a look at this one connect-assets
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen the js api
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: is one of the worst things
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: i've ever seen
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:50] `3rdEden: the source code is unreadable of uglify
[19:50] tbranyen: haha
[19:50] Aikar: tbranyen: mine doesnt look anything like haml, what do you mean? lol
[19:50] Fabryz: gave a quick look to both, must try to implement something
[19:50] tbranyen: Aikar: you're using it specifically for html pages
[19:50] tbranyen: how would i use nova in a javascript application to replace the date in a comment or something?
[19:51] Aikar: using "partialVars"
[19:51] tbranyen: so its possible?
[19:51] Aikar: its very similiar to EJS
[19:51] Aikar: yes
[19:51] tbranyen: oh okay cool
[19:51] tbranyen: i was just looking at your demo
[19:51] Aikar: except that the templates are rendered async
[19:51] Aikar: where as ejs is sync
[19:51] pgherveo_: Is there an easy way to keep in sync your json.package file or you have to manually add new entry everytimr you npm install
[19:51] Aikar: so you can put custom callback functions anywhere in page
[19:52] Aikar: and asynchronously control what data is written there
[19:52] Fabryz: pgherveo_ I manually add
[19:52] tbranyen: i was thinking about making combyne async, but it would cause a lot of overhead :-/
[19:52] tbranyen: since i would want to maintain sync behavior as well

[19:54] rbuck has joined the channel
[19:54] tbranyen: yeah Aikar i wanted mine to be if you return immediately inside a filter function it would be sync, but if you didn't return it would expect you to call a passed callback function
[19:54] tbranyen: but i dunno how good of an idea that is, especially since checking for a valid return is really hard

[20:00] Aikar: but basically if you do div(p(a(onRender(someFn)))) itll cache it as ['<div><p><a>', someFn, '</a></p></div>'] so and on render the someFn function is returned and fills in the data and returns the full html

[20:14] joshkehn: eldad87: What are you trying to do?
[20:14] eldad87: joshkehn, it seems like a nice framework
[20:15] joshkehn: Why start with a framework? 
[20:15] eldios has joined the channel
[20:15] joshkehn: I don't understand why the first thing people do is start adding stuff to the mix.
[20:15] eldad87: joshkehn, I'm developing MMORPG server, I did it in Java but... you know life are to short - so Now I'm trying to build components in node
[20:15] joshkehn: Start with node. Solve a problem. Work your way from there.
[20:15] joshkehn: eldad87: Are you serving HTML? 
[20:16] eldad87: joshkehn, no, It will just serve API calls and maybe images

[20:19] eldad87: joshkehn, I'm new to node.. sorry. I'm investigating it
[20:19] joshkehn: https://github.com/cloudhead/journey
[20:19] Daegalus: eldad87: Nothing special, I just setup GET/POST/DELETE/PUT calls for various functions, once it was called, I did stuff. Its really straight forward and easy to setup with Express. since it has app.get app.post app.put etc. Each type of REST type has a function to call in express, makes things easier
[20:20] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[20:20] Daegalus: plus its easier to get stuff out of the urls
[20:20] eldad87: Daegalus, thanks
[20:20] Daegalus: /user/:userid/edit
[20:20] Daegalus: :userid because a variable
[20:20] Daegalus: in the request
[20:20] Daegalus: that you can access directly
[20:20] Daegalus: you can also do direct REGEX
[20:20] eldad87: joshkehn, so node-static is something that manage the connection with the user? am I right?
[20:20] Daegalus: in tehre too
[20:20] joshkehn: eldad87: It's for all the static files.

[20:21] joshkehn: What do you mean “connections with the user”? 
[20:21] eldad87: joshkehn, but API isn't static..
[20:21] Nuck: eldad87: Connection manage?  You mean sessions?
[20:21] eldad87: joshkehn,  connection with the user - GET/POST/PUSH..
[20:21] joshkehn: eldad87: I'm not following?
[20:21] joshkehn: Those are request methods.
[20:21] eldad87: and sessions
[20:22] Nuck: eldad87: GET/POST/PUSH are request methods
[20:22] eldad87: for example, will it allow me to build chat app easily?
[20:22] Nuck: eldad87: That's better with a realtime library, like socket.io
[20:22] joshkehn: eldad87: There are several exceppent chat apps already written. I would take influence from those. 
[20:22] eldad87: Nuck, I'm sorry - I reffered to Session/Cookies and requests methods

[20:24] joshkehn: eldad87: Please tell me more about how you are going to use Cassandra.
[20:25] eldad87: just like it need to be used... key-value DB
[20:25] joshkehn: So what's wrong with Riak? Or Redis? What made you choose Cassandra?
[20:26] langworthy has joined the channel

[20:26] eldad87: I like Cassandra more, scale better, better community etc.. I'm used to work with it.

[20:27] joshkehn: Lol
[20:27] Vertice: =)
[20:27] anveo has joined the channel
[20:28] eldad87: Vertice, you mean Mongo is webscale!
[20:28] joshkehn: Everything is webscale.
[20:28] Vertice: the web is webscale
[20:28] jetienne: but mongo is more
[20:28] joshkehn: Bleh. 
[20:28] joshkehn: Whatever you say.
[20:29] jetienne: glad you see the truth
[20:29] eldad87: Nuck, so you suggest to use socket.io. is there any framework that give me ORM and that library out-of-the-box?
[20:29] EyePulp:  /dev/null ?
[20:29] Nuck: eldad87: ORM?
[20:29] Nuck: We have Mongoose?
[20:29] EyePulp: eldad87: mongoose is nice
[20:29] joshkehn: eldad87: What ORM do you normally use with Cassandra?
[20:30] joshkehn: *stabs Mongoose to death*
[20:30] eldad87: Nuck, Object Relational Mappin
[20:30] joshkehn: I wonder how you do /action in adium
[20:30] Nuck: eldad87: We don't do frameworks with zillions of features, pick what you wnat and npm nstall it all
[20:30] Nuck: joshkehn: /me?
[20:30] Nuck: eldad87: No need with Mongo
[20:30] joshkehn: ACTION test action?
[20:30] joshkehn: Got it
[20:31] eldad87: Joshkehn, you have hector, but I used cassandra more on PHP
[20:31] Nuck: joshkehn: It's /me in basically everything
[20:31] joshkehn: I last used colloque, but that was a while ago. 
[20:31] joshkehn: ACTION hates mongoose
[20:31] Nuck: Why?
[20:31] jetienne: eldad87: relax and try it. it is all super easy. nothing to be impressed

[20:32] p4r0 has joined the channel
[20:32] Nuck: I hated it too, then I gave it a second chance and now I <3 Mongoose
[20:32] joshkehn: I think that's the one. 
[20:32] eldad87: jetienne, what are you talking about? node/socket.io/mongo?
[20:32] Vertice: an object relational mapper built against an document db is a bit strange.
[20:32] joshkehn: Nuck: There is no reason to build schemas around Mongo
[20:32] Nuck: Vertice: It's not *that* kind of ORM
[20:32] Vertice: yeah i know
[20:32] killfill: joshkehn: i get much "Send request failed!" with -r :S
[20:32] jetienne: eldad87: node requires to understat javascript. the rest is simple
[20:32] Nuck: joshkehn: It's actually quite loose.
[20:32] Vertice: it seemed like it had too many assumptions for me
[20:33] Nuck: joshkehn: It looks rigid at a glance, but it really isn't
[20:33] Vertice: like that i was using mongodb for one
[20:33] eldad87: jetienne, I know JS... it just need to understand how things need to work..
[20:33] joshkehn: It also botches all sorts of insertions and fails with the most cryptic errors when it tries to do "smart" things during updates.
[20:33] Nuck: Vertice: Well, no shit, did you think it'd be non-mongo?
[20:33] dreamdust: You don't have to create realtionships in Cassandra
[20:33] Nuck: And that's wrong, joshkehn, you're doing it wrong.
[20:33] jetienne: eldad87: try it. it is simple. give a day or two to each. you will get it
[20:33] shapeshed has joined the channel
[20:33] Vertice: Nuck: i was being facetious

[20:34] joshkehn: ACTION smiles
[20:34] Nuck: Vertice: Okay, you'd be surprised how stupid some people get :P
[20:34] Nuck: joshkehn: Probably handled Mongoose lik mongo-native
[20:34] Nuck: I did it too
[20:34] Nuck: It broke
[20:34] eldad87: jetienne, thanks. this is really nice of you. but still, I'd like to understand what socket.io is for
[20:34] Nuck: That happens :V
[20:34] joshkehn: Nuck: I'm demo'ing mongoskin right not to see how that plays.
[20:34] joshkehn: I actually treated it more like a standard lib.
[20:34] jetienne: eldad87: socket.io is a websocket layer with a bunch of fallback options
[20:34] Nuck: joshkehn: It's nice, I switched from mongo to mongoskin to mongoose
[20:35] joshkehn: But adding new fields to models, defining a schema, etc. Just too much bullshit in the middle. 
[20:35] joshkehn: IMO
[20:35] jetienne: eldad87: then why websocket are usefull? it is cool to make low latency transfert back and forth with the server
[20:35] headz has joined the channel
[20:36] jetienne: eldad87:  go #socket.io and ask 3rdeden, he is skilled and helpfull
[20:36] eldad87: jetienne,  just websocket? what about request methods?
[20:36] Nuck: joshkehn: See, for anything big, you've gotta separate the database layer from the application layer, and before, I did that with function wrappers, now I do it with schemas
[20:36] Nuck: It's a lot better IMO
[20:36] joshkehn: Nuck: I do that with an API...
[20:36] jetienne: eldad87: what is "request method"
[20:36] djcoin has joined the channel
[20:36] joshkehn: And I've had excellent luck using Grails for a lot of that.
[20:36] Nuck: joshkehn: uh, this *is* an api.
[20:36] Nuck: What now?
[20:36] Nuck: I need to separate Express from mongo there
[20:37] stonebranch has joined the channel
[20:37] Nuck: If I try to combine them, my code will suck ass
[20:37] joshkehn: So you have one app running express
[20:37] eldad87: hetienne, post/get/push
[20:37] joshkehn: Another running an api.
[20:37] killfill: dont knowwhat ami  doing wrong.. :S   http://pastebin.com/6ASjTyJk
[20:38] Nuck: joshkehn: What do you mean by API?
[20:38] killfill: why do i get errors?
[20:38] jetienne: eldad87: this is plain http. if you want that, dont use socket.io
[20:38] mekwall: hmm... my site works in browsers but with any other tool I get either 500 or 400 Bad Request (url must be absolute)
[20:38] joshkehn: killfill: Add a -r option
[20:38] joshkehn: To ab
[20:38] mekwall: any ideas what it could be?
[20:38] killfill: joshkehn, yah, with that flag, the test finished, but with like 40% request failed.. :S
[20:38] joshkehn: Nuck: Just a database abstraction. I thought you were talking about from the express app.
[20:38] Nuck: eldad87: For a chat app, where you have realtime bidirectional communication, use Socket.IO
[20:38] joshkehn: killfill: Let me try it
[20:39] Nuck: joshkehn: So you just wrap all your database functions or what?
[20:39] EyePulp: eldad87: Or use Faye
[20:39] joshkehn: Nuck: One sec
[20:39] Nuck: like, db.addUser, etc.?

[20:40] isaacs: p4r0: some day, maybe soon :)
[20:41] eldad87: EyePulpm Faye?
[20:41] jetienne: eldad87: so socket.io is nice. socket.io is websocket + bunch of fallback options for browsers which doesnt support it
[20:41] joshkehn: Nuck: Once central connection class that everything else uses. Basically it's a wrapper around the HTTP api.
[20:41] Nuck: ugh magic lab is closing for lunch or something
[20:41] Nuck: bbl
[20:41] joshkehn: I'm not sure I understand your question ”wrap all your database functions”
[20:41] Nuck: joshkehn: meh
[20:41] p4r0: yep :) i wasted 2 hour figuring out how to install compress or gzbz2, while other module would install just fine ...
[20:41] p4r0: node-waf is a bitch !
[20:41] Nuck: joshkehn: I'll explain when I get on my iPhone
[20:41] jetienne: eldad87: i think the get/post/push is just an issue of vocabulary. it doesnt exist in websocket nor in socket.io
[20:41] joshkehn: Nuck: Okay. ;)
[20:41] killfill: joshkehn: what do you mean by having no problems?.. :)

[20:42] jetienne: `3rdEden: arf :)

[20:44] killfill: got node with brew..  (its 0.4.11)
[20:44] eldad87: `3rdEden, can you explain about the fallback please? is it possible for desktop clients that doesn't support websocekts to connect as well?
[20:45] `3rdEden: when websockets are not available socket.io will try out a bunch of different fallbacks
[20:45] jetienne: flash socket are super efficient for latency
[20:45] sdwrage has joined the channel
[20:45] jetienne: as efficient as websocket in my test
[20:45] sdwrage: Hey guys. Anyone have a no.de account?
[20:45] `3rdEden: if flashsocket is enabled it will try to use that, its websocket wrapper for native flash sockets
[20:45] `3rdEden: so it still allows you to have bidirectional transport without opening 2 http connections
[20:45] `3rdEden: if that is not available we will fallback to xhr-long polling
[20:46] `3rdEden: where it holds the connection on the server as long as possible untill it has a response to write against
[20:46] `3rdEden: if that fails, we can fallback to HTMLFile which is a IE only transport that uses the ActiveX HTMLFile to create a streaming iframe to receive the data
[20:47] `3rdEden: if even that fails, we fall back to jsonp polling, aka script tag injection with iframes for posting data.
[20:47] AaronMT has joined the channel
[20:47] `3rdEden: when that fails, you are basically fucked and you are probably hit a browser that does not support any webstandards what so ever ;P

[20:50] eldad87: should I use a framework or no?
[20:50] joshkehn: Eh.
[20:50] joshkehn: I'm going to say no, everyone else would probably say yes.
[20:50] jetienne: there is another option to change the transport order
[20:50] stagas has joined the channel
[20:50] joshkehn: Actually. If you add cookies I would say yes too. 
[20:50] joshkehn: Just because cookies suck.

[20:52] tbranyen: i was just thinking why did the node community adopt comma first, when trailing commas are allowed in v8
[20:53] tbranyen: seems kind of strange
[20:53] joshkehn: tbranyen: Because the formatting with comma first generates an error if you miss a comma
[20:53] joshkehn: While if you drop a comma at the end it just globalizes stuff
[20:53] tbranyen: thats a reason for variable declarations sure, but that has literally nothing to do with literal definitions

[20:56] eldad87: joshkehn, I didn't used it yet.. doing my research..
[20:56] Brandon_R: easy
[20:56] joshkehn: eldad87: Follow what TJ is saying.
[20:56] Brandon_R: more like a best practice question

[20:56] joshkehn: Brandon_R: Best practices are alway hard.
[20:56] jetienne: Brandon_R: local
[20:56] joshkehn: Local
[20:56] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[20:56] Brandon_R: with the package.json file?
[20:56] joshkehn: Sweet. That was easy.
[20:56] eldad87: tjholowaychuk, my project is a game server. something similar to chat because it's a MMORPG server
[20:56] jetienne: Brandon_R: inside node_modules
[20:57] joshkehn: Brandon_R: Probably best.
[20:57] jetienne: hehe
[20:57] joshkehn: jetienne: I think he means put it as a dependency in the package.json file
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: eldad87 straight-up node would probably be fine for that
[20:57] mkrecny: so any of you wise noders know about maxSockets over SSL?
[20:57] joshkehn: mkrecny: Sorry, no
[20:57] softdrink: Nethack + Minecraft.  someone get on that.
[20:57] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: i use express for buddymaze.com my webgl fps
[20:57] mkrecny: thx neway
[20:57] tbranyen: port nethack to node
[20:57] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: i think i use express for image upload :)

[21:01] eldad87: jet. wow this is amazing!!
[21:02] jetienne: eldad87: all in js :)

[21:04] joshkehn: Depends on what you think simple is.
[21:04] joshkehn: Sure it looks simple.
[21:04] joshkehn: But is it simple?
[21:04] eldad87: if you want, I have a great book about JS
[21:04] jetienne: eldad87: all the rest is simple. to understand socket.io do a mouse sharing stuff. like everybody joining your page will see the mouse of the other visitors

[21:07] joshkehn: Brandon_R: Question again?
[21:07] Brandon_R: nope
[21:07] joshkehn: jetienne: That wtfjs site is great.
[21:07] Brandon_R: just saying Hi
[21:07] Brandon_R: wtfjs is a cool site :)
[21:08] jetienne: joshkehn: it is :)

[21:08] joshkehn: eldad87: Let me know if you wrap your head around that one I send. It was fun to write out. ;)
[21:08] Brandon_R: any cool projects guys?
[21:08] eldad87: WTF is that map/reduce functions.. I never saw them before..
[21:08] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:09] joshkehn: .map will map an array based on existing values.
[21:09] aho: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[21:09] randylien has joined the channel
[21:09] joshkehn: .reduce will combine the values in the array.
[21:09] aho: same url with filter, reduce, reduceRight...
[21:09] Brandon_R: ok maybe one question lol
[21:09] joshkehn: See MDC and aho's link for more information.
[21:09] joshkehn: Brandon_R: Easy or Hard?
[21:09] progrock: lol, map, reduce, filter, forEach... no more need fo for or whil eloops 99% of the time :)
[21:10] joshkehn: progrock: Unless you're looking for performance. ;)
[21:10] aho: every, some, forEach...
[21:10] aho: love that stuff
[21:10] Brandon_R: i installed express locally but its giving command not found. how do i use express bin without cding into bin dir and making the app dir ../../../AppName
[21:10] progrock: joshkehn: havent done much performance testing comparing them.. but if your that anal, just make your minifier abstract those into conventional for/while loops
[21:10] progrock: no reason to make your code dirty
[21:11] joshkehn: progrock: It isn't alway being anal.
[21:11] joshkehn: One sec, let me dig up the jsperf I wrote.
[21:11] eldad87: aho, thanks
[21:11] aho: well, if you are doing something semi-heavy in that loop, the overhead becomes meaningless
[21:11] progrock: joshkehn: I get that, occassionally performance really matters.. eitehr way, my answer works
[21:11] aho: e.g. if you do some io or some heavy computations
[21:11] Brandon_R: also what should my first version be 0.1.0 or 0.0.0?
[21:12] eldad87: aho, what do you mean, why is that?
[21:12] eldad87: Jetienne, i'm after the instillation pat. what now - where I can put my code/how can I run the server?
[21:12] progrock: Now what I really want is to program into a minifier to remove "with" statements and rename the correct variables
[21:12] aho: if it's something tiny and brain dead (e.g. particle effects in a game), a regular loop might be worth the trouble
[21:12] mkrecny has left the channel
[21:12] joshkehn: progrock: Not if (a) you don't want / need a minification step for server deployment and (b) because they are closures you might run into some edge cases applying the transformation. 
[21:13] aho: eldad87, it's tiny overhead + tiny payload vs tiny overhead + gigantic payload
[21:13] aho: it's a ratio thing
[21:13] joshkehn: progrock: Here is a great example. http://jsperf.com/testing-array-explosion
[21:13] joshkehn: 8.5 million vs. 15k
[21:14] eldad87: aho, in other words you say that its a good practice to use map/reduce
[21:14] progrock: joshkehn: very interesting
[21:14] joshkehn: Oh wait. That first number might not be right.
[21:14] aho: clean code first
[21:14] progrock: still I enjoy much mroe how my code loosk using the array functions /(i know not the best excuse) but we're a scala shop, so leads to the more fu0nctional approach
[21:14] joshkehn: 331k vs 15k.
[21:14] joshkehn: Plus the 331k version is much more readable.
[21:15] Brandon_R: npm adduser isn't working
[21:16] eldad87: joshkeha, so map reduce is much faster... this is impressive.
[21:16] eldad87: guys, i'm after the instillation pat. what now - where I can put my code/how can I run the server?
[21:16] joshkehn: eldad87: No, it's not faster.
[21:16] joshkehn: That was my point.
[21:17] joshkehn: See http://jsperf.com/testing-array-explosion/2
[21:17] joshkehn: I removed the dumb test at the bottom
[21:17] eldad87: aho, just said the something else..

[21:18] tbranyen: i know you, lemme be vague and weird on irc about it
[21:18] artnez has joined the channel
[21:18] aho: i.e. if the overhead to actual payload ratio is kinda unfavorable
[21:18] b52: may some in short explain to me what "var exports = module.exports = .." does ?
[21:18] aho: if you do something heavy, that overhead quickly becomes insignificant
[21:18] tbranyen: b52: allows you to attach but not override exports
[21:18] tbranyen: module.exports does the same thing, but allows you to override
[21:18] b52: is that some sort of automagic?
[21:18] tbranyen: sure
[21:18] b52: looks weird to me
[21:19] eldad87: aho, so if i'm doing heavy calculation? should I use map/reduce then?
[21:19] tbranyen: if javascript looks weird to you...
[21:19] tbranyen: i dunno what to tell ya
[21:19] b52: well, the normal js behavour would be to override it, wouldnt it?
[21:19] aho: if it makes your code look nicer, sure why not?
[21:19] tbranyen: commonjs spec says to attach
[21:20] tbranyen: not override

[21:49] netlemur: D'oh
[21:49] eldad87: but should it be in a specific path?
[21:50] AvianFlu: you'd run node example.js and then go to http://127.0.0.1:1337 in your browser
[21:50] eldad87: is it the regular way to run an app?
[21:50] AvianFlu: eldad87 you can pretty much run it anywhere
[21:50] AvianFlu: that script isn't serving any files, so it will run wherever you put it
[21:50] AvianFlu: it just spits out that message to anyone who connects

So far, I've only had experience managing a simple, single instance express app on EC2 without load balancing. Heroku is a lot more expensive and there's of course WebSockets not being supported on Heroku…So, what do you guys think, is Heroku worth it?

[22:00] AvianFlu: have it listen on 0.0.0.0
[22:00] eldad87: so I'm trying to access it: 192.168.0.3:1337
[22:00] AvianFlu: 0.0.0.0 means either 'any interface' or 'all interfaces', I forget which
[22:00] eldad87: and it doesn't work...
[22:00] eldad87: what do you mean...
[22:01] AvianFlu: in the script
[22:01] AvianFlu: where it says 127.0.0.1
[22:01] AvianFlu: replace it with 0.0.0.0

[22:14] creationix: mkrecny: basically, it's like this: 1- add package.json to your project that defined dependencies, 2-clone the repo on your server, 3- run "npm install" in the clone, 4-write upstart script and start it
[22:14] DrMcKay: time for `killall -9` cannon
[22:15] creationix: mkrecny: oh, and build node using nvm goes in there before step 3

[22:17] creationix: that works
[22:17] creationix: mkrecny: the only problem with just upstart or init.d is there are bugs in node that make a server die, but the process doesn't die
[22:18] creationix: it will just be running idle and never accept connections
[22:18] DrMcKay: this one seems cool: https://github.com/beatgammit/updating-server
[22:18] creationix: something like monit could help with that

[22:21] jmoyers: yes, thats normal behavior guy 
[22:21] DrMcKay: creationix: oh man. this video was like < 100 MB
[22:22] creationix: DrMcKay: other than running out of file descriptors when there were too many concurrent viewers, the node process handled it great
[22:22] creationix: DrMcKay: yeah, like 10 or 20mb
[22:22] guy: jmoyers: the book says that it should list all packages that contain 'forever' string in the name
[22:22] jmoyers: nope
[22:22] jmoyers: typo
[22:22] jmoyers: thats npm search
[22:22] guy: how can I list all available forever package version
[22:22] DrMcKay: creationix: because it's node :). ulimit -n is a problem sometimes
[22:22] DrMcKay: creationix: anyway, you're famous ;)

[22:23] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[22:23] jmoyers: i'd go to http://search.npmjs.org/#/forever ;-)
[22:24] jmoyers: but im sure theres a way on the cli
[22:24] creationix: DrMcKay: yeah, so that's only about 10k views, but more than I get on most days.
[22:25] guy: ACTION tries to install 0.6.6 instead of 0.6.7 and see if that will work
[22:25] DrMcKay: also, is there a way to get number of open file descriptors without doing nasty things with /proc?
[22:25] creationix: howtonode.org averages about 2k visitors a day, I suspect most are bots
[22:25] jmoyers: guy there's probably a better way, but npm view shows that data
[22:26] creationix: DrMcKay: no idea
[22:26] DrMcKay: creationix: install Google Analytics, it's very useful
[22:26] creationix: DrMcKay: but with a smart fd cache, I could easily re-use the fd for multiple streaming clients.  I think I can at least

[22:26] DrMcKay: yeah, I suppose that's libuv thing, I'll harass core guys tomorrow
[22:27] DrMcKay: creationix: or just use a static file server
[22:27] creationix: blasphemy!

[22:27] guy: good two hours wasted.
[22:27] ReshadN: Ok I'm kicking off a new project... bigger than any other project I've ever done. It's going to be a major learning experience for myself and I'm putting all my eggs in one basket... that's the node.js basket. So I have some questions about feasibility/options with Node as a base/ framework.
[22:28] creationix: besides, people want to use node in production, they are always asking how it holds up.  If I don't even use it for my small static sites, how much trust can I give others
[22:28] DrMcKay: creationix: no, a node static server
[22:28] creationix: DrMcKay: it is
[22:28] DrMcKay: cloudhead had a pretty decent one
[22:28] creationix: DrMcKay: but a simple noe
[22:28] creationix: DrMcKay: nah, I've written a few, better use one of mine
[22:29] DrMcKay: creationix: OK
[22:29] DrMcKay: ACTION rewrites all his apps
[22:29] creationix: ReshadN: ask away
[22:29] Nathan_ has joined the channel
[22:29] DrMcKay: creationix: also, you could simply load that file into memory and just serve it
[22:30] ReshadN: Ok.. this is going to be an inventory management system... possibly 100k plus database...
[22:30] creationix: DrMcKay: indeed, but I have multiple gigabyte media files too, that's not a good path long term
[22:30] ReshadN: key aspects of this system should be reliability and security.. as I guess all systems depend on these features
[22:30] DrMcKay: it gets even better with latest v8 patch
[22:30] ReshadN: would you recommend building a web app with node/ express/ etc. Or do you think it's unrealistic at this point to build a full scale web app?
[22:30] creationix: DrMcKay: nah, the v8 patch doesn't affect that.  Buffers are outside v8 already.  I have an experimental node database running about 16gb of stuff in ram
[22:31] creationix: ReshadN: express is fine
[22:31] DrMcKay: creationix: ah, sneaky. good to know

[22:32] ReshadN: any advantages of express over rails? and do you think it'll take longer to build a node app vs a ruby based app?
[22:32] creationix: ReshadN: probably the hardest part will be robustness, uncaught exceptions do nasty things to node programs
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: ReshadN express is very non-rails
[22:32] creationix: ReshadN: and you can't catch exceptions in third-party code if it's behind even a single callback

[22:33] DrMcKay: good night everyone
[22:34] ReshadN: tjholowaychuk: can you explain further on the express vs rails point please?
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: ReshadN express is more like sinatra (the framework that inspired express originally)
[22:34] ReshadN: creationix: do you think it's worth spending the time to build in node now?
[22:34] Vertice: it's lot of fun
[22:34] creationix: tjholowaychuk: how do you guys structure your productions express apps.  I assume learnboost uses it?
[22:34] creationix: ReshadN: I do, but you should be aware of the weaknesses
[22:35] creationix: ReshadN: some problems are a lot easier and some are harder, it's just different
[22:35] cjm has joined the channel
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: creationix we just have our routes split out into logical files, ./routes/{student,teacher}.js blah blah
[22:35] creationix: tjholowaychuk: so somewhat controller oriented?
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: nope
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: still app.get etc in there
[22:35] ReshadN: creationix: good points.. but it's not helping me make the decision faster haha ... but I appreciate the time
[22:36] creationix: more http interface oriented than
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: there are some benefits to controllers but also more difficult to debug and at times trickier to reason with
[22:36] ReshadN: creationix: got any recommendations for a full stack?
[22:36] fizx has joined the channel
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: I find it really beneficial to get what you see

[22:37] creationix: tjholowaychuk: nah, I prefer the raw route interface, I was just wondering what you ended up using for actual apps
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: i prefer it too

[22:45] ReshadN: is this bigger than one man? haha
[22:45] creationix: ReshadN: probably

[22:45] creationix: ReshadN: how critical is it if you fail the first time or two?
[22:45] halcyon918: hey folks... I'm trying to add some middleware to an Express "get" call, where the middleware exists in a separate file.. is this feasible?  var middleware = require('./middleware.js'); app.get('/', middleware.doSomething, ...);
[22:45] hakunin has joined the channel
[22:45] ReshadN: actually it's not critical if I fail the first few times
[22:46] creationix: ReshadN: if you can afford to fail and start over, then it's probably fine
[22:46] halcyon918: and middleware.js has:   exports.doSomething(...)
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: halcyon918 nothing wrong with that
[22:46] halcyon918: er, exports.doSomething = function ...
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: require() is the way to go for sure
[22:46] creationix: halcyon918: module.exports = function setup(args, go, here){ some code; return function handle(req, res, next); };
[22:47] creationix: halcyon918: something like that
[22:47] zeade has joined the channel
[22:47] creationix: then you use it with `require('./mymodule')(setup, args, here)`
[22:47] halcyon918: tjholowaychuk: I tried it but now my express "get" isn't working... all I did was move the function to a separate js, export the function, require the middleware, but then app.get stopped working

[22:51] halcyon918: which delegates to the middleware: http://screencast.com/t/G9N8XBqD
[22:51] halcyon918: (I've trimmed a bit off that's a bit verbose)
[22:51] halcyon918: all this code works fine when the "getNode" function is in the same file as Express

[23:11] tbranyen: just cygwin
[23:11] creationix: luxigo: what's your goal
[23:11] creationix: luxigo: you already have the array v and you want to know what went into it originally?
[23:12] luxigo: maybe it's because i dont know how dlls are working... i created a dll project and added the sources and libs .. it compiles but i cant load it

[23:13] blueadept: creationix: well the reason is basically i'm filtering for null values
[23:13] creationix: blueadept: if all you're given is an array with values in it, there is no way to know how those values got in there
[23:13] blueadept: if the value is null, i want to assign it ''
[23:13] blueadept: if not, i want the value to then be sanitized
[23:13] blueadept: from an string int to a real int
[23:13] creationix: blueadept: Array.prototype.map
[23:13] luxigo: i dont know neither and I hate windows :-) but i need it running on it since most potential customers are using windows...

[23:15] creationix: luxigo: I do know that the windows's addon story isn't solved yet
[23:15] creationix: Currently the core team is porting node to native windows, but afaik, addons won't be first-class in windows for a while
[23:16] blueadept: creationix: it still prints either the array position, which is 0,1,? or the actual values that i assigned them to begin with
[23:16] blueadept: hm
[23:16] nuck: creationix: I think isaacs is already trying to get NPM working on Windows
[23:16] creationix: blueadept: map returns a new array
[23:17] nuck: Once that happens, non-native modules will be first-class on Windows
[23:17] creationix: nuck: sure, but that won't help for binary addons if the build system isn't worked out yet
[23:17] luxigo: creationix: javascript addons are working yet
[23:17] nuck: And I recall something about compiled addons being posted as binaries on npm or something
[23:17] creationix: nuck: right, js addons should be working shortly
[23:17] luxigo: creationix: im not far i try some more..

[23:34] joshkehn: Was I unclear on that? Opps.
[23:34] joshkehn: No, not really
[23:34] Brandon_R: i need to read up on this stuff
[23:35] Brandon_R: what would you say is the cloest textmate clone for linux
[23:35] Brandon_R: eclipse and netbeans are too heavy for me
[23:35] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: just start using vim, trust me, in a year or two it's gonna be the best editor you've evar known :)
[23:35] joshkehn: Sublimt Text 2
[23:35] joshkehn: But Vim really rocks
[23:36] mikeric has left the channel
[23:36] Brandon_R: i use emacs but it had too many options
[23:36] Brandon_R: i like the clean look of textmate
[23:36] joshkehn: Try Sublime.
[23:37] mikeric has joined the channel
[23:37] Brandon_R: k
[23:37] Brandon_R: does it support jade and less?
[23:38] joshkehn: You don't need either. 
[23:38] joshkehn: ;)
[23:38] theCole has joined the channel
[23:38] joshkehn: It's compatible with all TextMate bundles.
[23:38] joshkehn: So it should.
[23:38] Brandon_R: cool
[23:38] Brandon_R: i'll try it out
[23:38] Brandon_R: emacs is still good for erlang though as it's its offcial editor :)
[23:39] shipit has joined the channel
[23:39] Brandon_R: do you guys know erlang? im learning it
[23:39] githogori has joined the channel
[23:39] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: i know it pretty well
[23:39] Brandon_R: cool
[23:39] Brandon_R: what apps have you made using it so far?
[23:39] creationix has left the channel
[23:40] Brandon_R: i was thinking of making a nodejs + erlang interface just for fun
[23:40] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: nothing open source, i'm afraid :)
[23:40] Brandon_R: ok :) anything i know or may have used then?
[23:41] Dmitrijus: nope :)
[23:41] shanebo has joined the channel
[23:41] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: why would you want to write nodejs interface? :)
[23:42] Dmitrijus: the programing models are quite different :)
[23:42] Brandon_R: just for fun. to gain a better understand of node and erlang.
[23:43] Brandon_R: do you have a github?
[23:44] tim_smar1 has joined the channel
[23:47] lz: anyone interested in an iOS socket.io wrapper?
[23:48] jmoyers: lz there is one already, no?
[23:48] skm has joined the channel
[23:49] sam350 has joined the channel
[23:49] lz: there's a websocket specific one
[23:50] matjaz has joined the channel
[23:50] AvianFlu_ has joined the channel
[23:50] lz: just judging interest, I wrote a simple wrapper and i'd like to clean it up and push it to the community
[23:50] Frippe has joined the channel

[23:53] jmoyers: Iz i know i talked to someone at node camp that was doing socketio wrapped in a webview instance with javascript core bindings
[23:53] willwhite has joined the channel
[23:54] jmoyers: lz ^
[23:54] jmoyers: and theres this: https://github.com/fpotter/socketio-cocoa
[23:54] lz: that's actually what i'm doing as well
[23:54] lz: the socketio-cocoa project doesn't work anymore
[23:54] lz: which is why I wrote the wrapper
[23:54] jmoyers: ah
[23:55] jmoyers: well, im a mac desktop developer, but I do most of my communication via regular old sockets in real time situations, haven't run into the use case where socketio would be convenient yet
[23:56] infynyxx has joined the channel
[23:56] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[23:57] lz: I'd have to agree with you actually. I needed it purely for a quick ios prototype where socket.io was already being used for the web client.
[23:58] lz: Actually I think there are issues with socket.io over cell networks
[23:58] rabidsnail has joined the channel
[23:58] mjr_: There are issues with all sorts of protocols over cell networks.
[23:59] rabidsnail: I can't get amqp to play nice with cluster. Messages from rabbitmq go to a random worker.
[23:59] mjr_: It'd be fun to have a really good socketio implementation on iOS
[23:59] Vertice has joined the channel
[23:59] rabidsnail: which is strange, because pg and redis don't seem to be having this problem
[23:59] chbrown has joined the channel
[23:59] nuck: paul graham and redis?
[23:59] lz: the wrapper works fine over wifi but has it's hiccups and timeouts over 3g
[23:59] nuck: I am confus.
