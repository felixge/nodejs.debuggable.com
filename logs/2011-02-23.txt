[01:46] jeromegn: So I'm wondering if I'm using the right technique here: I created a class/module (TweetMuncher) which takes as argument an array of tweets and a callback. for each tweets it emits an event "munched" (or "error") and then something catches that event and do stuff with the munched data... My question is: should I use an array as the argument or just a single object (a tweet)? is there a safe pattern here I should use here?
[01:46] edude03 has joined the channel

[01:49] colinsullivan: I installed node and npm from github
[01:49] isaacs: colinsullivan: strange.
[01:49] colinsullivan: then installed node from .tar.gz off website
[01:50] colinsullivan: same thing
[01:50] isaacs: colinsullivan: my guess would be that the openssl binding you have is not good.
[01:50] NovaDesu has joined the channel
[01:50] colinsullivan: hmm ok i'll look into that 
[01:50] malkomal_: is it possible to turn off logging in express/connect for certain types of requests?

[01:50] devongovett: does anyone have a coupon code for Joyent's http://no.de/ hosting service that they'd want to share?
[01:50] isaacs: colinsullivan: also: if you want to install *this code right here*, then use "make dev" (that's changing in just a second or three)
[01:51] isaacs: colinsullivan: make install is becoming 'make latest'
[01:51] NovaDesu: hey guys I've got a question. I'm fairly new to node.js and I want to update my current version, 2.5, to the newest, how would I do this on ubuntu server?

[01:51] colinsullivan: isaacs: fails on same step with ``sudo make install dev``
[01:52] isaacs: colinsullivan: ok
[01:52] isaacs: colinsullivan: yeah, def something weird with your openssl lib
[01:52] colinsullivan: isaacs: macports openssl package http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/openssl/Portfile
[01:52] isaacs: colinsullivan: can you do this and gist the output?  node cli.js install -ddd

[02:02] isaacs: colinsullivan: unless it's some odd permision thing
[02:02] colinsullivan: hmm possibly
[02:02] isaacs: colinsullivan: but that should have failed at the file open, not the sha calculation.
[02:02] isaacs: colinsullivan: anyway, i added some silly logging around the sha calculation stuff, so maybe if it comes back, it'll be easier to diagnose.
[02:03] colinsullivan: isaacs: thanks, i'll let you know
[02:03] jesusabdullah: Is there a good way to see whether you're using OSX or Linux from node?

[02:10] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel

[02:10] marcello3d: is it possible to access browser cookies from socket.io, or do you have to do it yourself?
[02:10] eresair has joined the channel
[02:10] colinsullivan: isaacs: yea uninstalling the openssl package is not going to work out so well because there are a million things that depend on it currently working properly.  So ./configure —without-ssl ?
[02:11] SubStack: marcello3d: yes, but it's hackish
[02:11] marcello3d: I see client.request.headers
[02:11] isaacs: colinsullivan: yeah, as a last resort
[02:11] isaacs: colinsullivan: it limits what npm can do if it doesn't have openssl bindings
[02:11] isaacs: colinsullivan: maybe rebuilding/reinstalling openssl might fix it, or (sorry) convert to homebrew?
[02:12] marcello3d: SubStack: is that what you do?
[02:12] SubStack: marcello3d: socketio.request.headers has the http headers before middleware
[02:12] colinsullivan: I'll give it a try

[02:13] marcello3d: ah
[02:13] marcello3d: are those headers available in every transport socket.io uses?
[02:14] SubStack: the code overhaul should be done tonight but it might take me a little longer to refactor the documentation and examples
[02:14] marcello3d: or are they blocked from, say, flash
[02:14] SubStack: marcello3d: I'm not sure but it seems to work with websockets and xhr-multipart at least

[02:18] langworthy has joined the channel
[02:19] zzak: while we're on the topic, it bugs me that all the source url's 404 from search.npmjs.org

[02:20] zzak: y u no use gsub?!
[02:21] SubStack: marcello3d: all of the protocol logic now lives in dnode-protocol, an entirely separate module
[02:21] SubStack: and dnode 0.6.0 will work out of the box with browserify
[02:21] marcello3d: oh cool
[02:22] marcello3d: browserify scares me a little with its wrapper :)

[02:23] tfe_ has joined the channel
[02:24] SubStack: most of the bulk is es5-shim anyhow
[02:24] marcello3d: es5-shim?

[02:25] SubStack: I want to get jade to work in browserify soon too
[02:25] marcello3d: events.js?
[02:25] marcello3d: hmm no
[02:25] SubStack: client-side rendering woo
[02:25] tfe_ has left the channel
[02:25] jesusabdullah: es5-shim defines a bunch of stuff that may not be in some javascript engines, but it compatible with ecmastript 5
[02:25] colinsullivan: isaacs: installing openssl from scratch worked
[02:25] colinsullivan: isaacs: thanks
[02:26] SubStack: events.js is just EventEmitters
[02:26] SubStack: directly copied from the node source
[02:26] isaacs: colinsullivan: rad
[02:26] marcello3d: yea I saw
[02:26] temp01 has joined the channel
[02:26] marcello3d: hmmm
[02:26] marcello3d: I guess I'd rather share code in the reverse
[02:27] marcello3d: ie make browser-style code work as an include in node.js
[02:27] SubStack: browser-side require() is so nice for organizing code sanely
[02:27] tfe_ has joined the channel
[02:27] marcello3d: yea, but I'm going to flatfile the whole thing anyway
[02:27] SubStack: native browser-style is painful
[02:27] SubStack: marcello3d: but browserify flattens it for you automatically
[02:27] jesusabdullah: ^__^
[02:27] marcello3d: so I'd rather var foo = require("foo") just get replaced with the thing
[02:28] SubStack: so you can keep the logic split up across files and compile at runtime
[02:28] SubStack: >_<
[02:28] marcello3d: rather than wrapped up in extra closures and stuff
[02:28] insin: it's dead easy to go that way if the browser side code is already written though. I got my forms & DOM/HTML builder libraries working with Node in minutes :)
[02:28] dguttman_ has joined the channel
[02:28] marcello3d: insin: with eval or require?
[02:28] lyetz has joined the channel
[02:29] marcello3d: SubStack: I get it, it's a great idea, but I'm picky :D
[02:29] SubStack: browserify also lets you use modules from npm so :p
[02:29] insin: neither, one was already a single script and the other was already being built into one, just added the exports and mocked out the DOM
[02:29] SubStack: I can use seq and traverse browser-side, which is super groovy
[02:29] marcello3d: that's cool
[02:30] marcello3d: how would you handle the case where you have shared code that's requiring something else, but you need a browser-specific and server-specific version
[02:31] marcello3d: e.g. foo.js gets used in node.js and browser
[02:31] marcello3d: and foo.js requires canvas.js
[02:31] marcello3d: which is implemented in browser natively, but as a native node lib on node.js?
[02:31] SubStack: you can just if (typeof window === 'undefined') {} for now
[02:32] twoism has joined the channel
[02:32] marcello3d: ah
[02:32] marcello3d: that works
[02:32] SubStack: I'll probably set process.version to 'browser'
[02:32] SubStack: since that's a little cleaner to test
[02:32] marcello3d: and then just put the server-side require in there
[02:32] SubStack: sure
[02:33] marcello3d: too bad it doesn't get preprocessed out :)

[04:47] megana: so what does everyone do when they want to host node.js?
[04:47] megana: I know you can't all just be writing init scripts
[04:47] megana: is there some utility for make xml config files or something to manage each site?
[04:51] tmpvar: woah, xml?
[04:51] tmpvar: megana, i use monit and init scripts
[04:52] megana: tmpvar, just a thought
[04:52] megana: well, it would probably be json ;)
[04:52] ChrisPartridge: s/xml/json? :)
[04:52] megana: remember tomcat?
[04:52] tmpvar: nightmares, yes
[04:52] megana: it would be nice if we had something kindddaaaa like that
[04:52] megana: just not awful like WAR files
[04:52] tmpvar: connect is similar
[04:52] geoffeg: recommended command line options parser?
[04:52] tmpvar: you can do vhosts
[04:53] megana: oh ya?
[04:53] chapel: geoffeg: check out optimist by SubStack
[04:53] tmpvar: megana, in that you can specify vhosts
[04:53] sechrist: How do I return a static file in express? I basically want to map / to send index.html
[04:53] chapel: if you want to handle vhosts in a more robust manner, check out cluster
[04:53] geoffeg: chapel: funny, i clicked onto his github page right as you said that :)
[04:53] tmpvar: lol
[04:53] megana: but there's no easy way to restart the site after modifying the source though
[04:53] ChrisPartridge: sechrist: staticProvider
[04:54] tmpvar: megana, in development mode or production
[04:54] SubStack: sechrist: staticProvider serves up index.html automatically
[04:54] megana: you have to kill && node
[04:54] SubStack: for / routes
[04:54] megana: production
[04:54] ChrisPartridge: megana: there are a few tools to manage this already

[05:13] at133 has joined the channel
[05:13] Aria: Hehe. That's easy, entinteractive.
[05:13] Aria: It runs as a daemon and accepts the connection itself.
[05:14] polotek: mm2001: but it installs cleanly for me right now
[05:14] mm2001: polotek: thx!   (mm2001 walks away bleeding ... towards node 2.x)
[05:14] polotek: I think I'm using an older version of npm though. lemme try upgrading
[05:14] entinteractive: interesting... so for some reason its not loading for me unless i cli "node default.js"  then try to load the browser
[05:15] entinteractive: ...otherwise it just sits there loading forever
[05:16] Aria: Well, yeah, it has to be running. Are you proxying to it?
[05:16] entinteractive: what could i potentially be doing wrong here, am i missing a module perhaps?
[05:16] Aria: If all you've got on the server is node, then it should give ECONNREFUSED when it's not running
[05:16] entinteractive: ive also got plesk :D
[05:16] Aria: but proxies will often accept the connection and then hang until hopefully the backend comes back.
[05:16] Aria: plesk, which then implies Apache, ne?
[05:17] entinteractive: yep
[05:17] mm2001: polotek: thanks!
[05:17] entinteractive: and im using a RewriteCond to catch it
[05:17] entinteractive: got a few hints from here... http://bigbangtechnology.com/post/installation_configuration_deployment_node.js_applications_on_media_temple
[05:18] mm2001: entinteractive: have you tried a different port and then wget to localhost on that port?  I battled with this and discovered it had more to do with iptables, virtualbox NAT/network settings, you name it ;)
[05:18] Aria: Ah, in that case, you just need to run the service some way more permanent than a terminal that you then close.
[05:18] Aria: Apache won't start it for you.
[05:18] Aria: node is entirely separate.
[05:19] entinteractive: i see
[05:19] entinteractive: is this what the supervisor module is for
[05:19] Aria: (node is one level lower than, say, rails -- node is not specific to just web apps.)
[05:19] Aria: Yeah, supervisor processes are good for things like this.
[05:19] Aria: Or start it in an @reboot rule in cron, or ... so many options, the problem is picking one.
[05:19] entinteractive: still getting my head around it :P cheers
[05:19] polotek: isaacs: you were saying something about upgrading npm 0.3

[05:20] isaacs: polotek: the big gotchas: package.json must be valid json (quoted keys, no comments), and there's no lib dir mapping
[05:20] mm2001: entinteractive: ah, yes Aria is on the right track.  I'm facing the same problem soon.  For quick debugging I just started it with "nohup node default.js &" - but that won't restart it if it dies

[05:27] isaacs: mm2001: still not entirely sure why it wasn't breaking for me, or why what i did to fix it fixed it.
[05:28] isaacs: Aria: you should bind jspp to it!!
[05:28] polotek: Aria: awesome
[05:28] slaskis: isaacs: npm info latest = npm@0.3.7 not supported by node@v0.4.0

[05:38] polotek: mm2001: oh :/
[05:39] polotek: you also need xml2-config in your path
[05:39] polotek: it's utility that comes with libxml2
[05:39] polotek: you do have libxml2 installed right :)
[05:39] slaskis: tried hash -r
[05:39] slaskis: no change
[05:39] slaskis: isaacs: ^^
[05:39] losing has joined the channel
[05:40] isaacs: slaskis: ok, i just provisioned a brand new no.de, it's running node 0.4
[05:40] mm2001: polotek: by luck rather than planning, yes, yum reports that libxml2 is installed ;)
[05:40] isaacs: slaskis: did the curl | sh trick, and it worked
[05:40] slaskis: danit
[05:40] slaskis: damnit
[05:40] isaacs: slaskis: did you set a node-version config orsomething?
[05:40] isaacs: slaskis: what's ~/.npmrc have in it, anything interesting?
[05:41] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[05:41] slaskis: isaacs: hmm, might be there
[05:41] isaacs: slaskis: https://gist.github.com/840075
[05:41] isaacs: see?
[05:41] isaacs: proof!
[05:41] slaskis: i have a node-version in there
[05:41] slaskis: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/d687c6d1adce60a66df9
[05:41] slaskis: i'll try to remove it
[05:42] isaacs: aha!!!!
[05:42] isaacs: yeah, remove that
[05:42] mm2001: polotek: hmm, no xml2-config in my path.  Looking for it
[05:42] isaacs: slaskis: node-version config is just to "fake" the node version temporarily to install things that require different versions of node than what you have.
[05:42] slaskis: removed npmrc entirely
[05:42] isaacs: slaskis: which is a weird edge-case that you should never ever touch
[05:42] polotek: mm2001: how did you get libxml2? what os are you on?
[05:42] isaacs: slaskis: ohno!!!
[05:42] isaacs: you do need that on no.de
[05:42] slaskis: isaacs: haha, ooh
[05:43] slaskis: lucky i copied it ;)
[05:43] polotek: how is it no one has wrapped jshint in a nice command-line utility yet?
[05:43] isaacs: slaskis: indeed :)
[05:43] mm2001: polotek: centos 55 - googling now
[05:43] isaacs: slaskis: you also don't need the tar defined more than once.
[05:43] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[05:43] mm2001: polotek: seems I need libxml2-devel -- will try that 
[05:43] polotek: mm2001: libxml2 is installable by any decent linux package manager
[05:43] isaacs: slaskis: looks like my install script puts it there if it detects a non-standard one.  it should probably only do that if it's not already there.
[05:43] polotek: mm2001: yeah probably
[05:44] polotek: ACTION really needs to get to know the linux package ecosystem better
[05:44] isaacs: slaskis: `npm config delete node-version` woulda done it. (for next time)
[05:44] slaskis: isaacs: hah, well now i get out of memory errors
[05:44] isaacs: slaskis: weird...
[05:44] mm2001: polotek: success!
[05:44] slaskis: isaacs: such strange errors, different every time
[05:44] mm2001: polotek: isaacs: thanks!!
[05:45] isaacs: mm2001: np :)
[05:46] polotek: mm2001: ditto
[05:46] polotek: but now I have a question.
[05:46] mischief has joined the channel
[05:46] polotek: did you read the readme?
[05:46] polotek: be honest :)
[05:47] nornagon_ has joined the channel
[05:47] briznad has joined the channel
[05:48] mm2001: polotek: honestly, yes, I did read it.  But clearly not closely enough.  I was trying to work out which xml library to install and read many readmes along the way.
[05:49] polotek: mm2001: no worries. it's definitely not good enough
[05:49] polotek: it doesn't even mention libxml-devel
[05:49] mm2001: polotek: so when you said "scons", I banged my head "doh"
[05:49] polotek: I want to make it better
[05:49] polotek: what other things did you have problems with?
[05:51] mm2001: polotek: tho I didn't catch the xml2-config reference until I just re-read it now.  It would be better in the requirements section  (e.g. with a note that libxml2 and libxml2-devel should be installed)
[05:52] mm2001: polotek: also, its great that you have the test commands there -- but with the magic of npm, I have no idea where the source is installed now and hence no idea where to go to run the tests.  (Not complaining!  Just feedback as you requested)
[05:52] polotek: mm2001: yeah doing that now
[05:52] isaacs: mm2001: that's getting better.
[05:52] polotek: it's possible to have npm run your tests as well
[05:52] isaacs: mm2001: require.resolve("libxmljs") is helpful
[05:52] polotek: working on that
[05:53] wadey has joined the channel
[05:53] isaacs: polotek: looks like all kinds of errors when i do `npm test libxmljs`
[05:53] mm2001: polotek: also, it would be awesome to have the example that's on the front page of your github wiki in the actual readme file.  
[05:53] isaacs: well, just one kind... but over and over
[05:53] isaacs: Memory tag error occurs :0x10070fa28

[05:54] mm2001: polotek: since when scanning many modules, that's the page most often linked to and looked at
[05:54] isaacs: mm2001: isn't that page the actual readme already?
[05:55] isaacs: oh, wiki, nvm
[05:55] mm2001: isaacs: your http://search.npmjs.org page is excellent!  Found it very useful!

[06:05] samcday_: I can't seem to get it to work ;(
[06:05] mm2001: polotek: it looks great now. Maybe it was there before and I missed it... apologies if so!  it was a long slog to get to libxmljs via several deadends.
[06:05] polotek: mm2001: no I just pushed that
[06:05] polotek: the pre-conditions section
[06:06] polotek: I'm making some more updates

[06:10] samcday_: node-profiler*

[06:17] samcday_: You can start/stop the profiler from JS.
[06:17] samcday_: profiler.pause(); profiler.resume();
[06:17] samcday_: I only want to profile certain parts of my code
[06:19] samcday_: The problem is, I can see v8.log has plenty of data in it when I use prof_lazy, but linux-ticks-processor isn't recognizing anything
[06:20] polotek: mm2001: several more updates to readme and wiki. rearranged things a bit
[06:20] polotek: hopefully it works a bit better
[06:21] mape: samcday_: Oh k, well if you figure anything out and it doesn't break the api feel free to do a pull request

[06:51] polotek: isaacs: hey, so what's the deal with package.json?
[06:51] polotek: specifically main vs lib properties
[06:51] isaacs: polotek: oh.  um.. use a main module.
[06:51] isaacs: that's the deal with them :)
[06:51] isaacs: if you want to dive into a package, just specify the full path to what you want.
[06:51] isaacs: this lib directory mapping thing isn't actually required, and isn't all that helpful.
[06:52] polotek: is lib is ignored right now
[06:53] polotek: well referring to submodules by relative paths still works
[06:53] polotek: so that's good
[06:53] mape: samcday_: Neat, I'll take a look at it later today

[06:59] isaacs: polotek: yeah, lib is ignored.
[07:00] isaacs: polotek: the whole package dir as-is is linked to the node_modules folder, so require("foo/lib/bar") works like require("foo/bar") used ot.
[07:00] isaacs: polotek: it just got simpler.  one less level of indirection
[07:00] SubStack: it cleaned up the browserify code tons
[07:01] polotek: isaacs: I'm fine with it, just wanted to make sure I understood
[07:01] isaacs: yeah, it hurts at first, but nothing compared to the promise-cb switch
[07:01] polotek: hey SubStack, got a free million dollar idea for you
[07:01] isaacs: in the end, i think these changes are for the better

[09:39] sa_: what's felix's module?
[09:40] sa_: i download node & express & connect &mysql driver
[09:40] sa_: there are anything else?
[09:40] mauritslamers: sa_: yep: Thoth :)

[09:41] joecorcoran has joined the channel
[09:43] sa_: thoth for what?
[09:43] sa_: why i should install it?
[09:44] mauritslamers: You don't have to install it
[09:44] mauritslamers: but it comes with a ready made mysql implementation based on node-mysql
[09:44] seivan: Hmm
[09:44] seivan: Wargames doesn't seem to work that well 
[09:44] mauritslamers: and if you are serving web apps, you get XHR and websocket for free :)

[09:56] sa_: so if the Thoth help me 
[09:57] mauritslamers: sa_: depends on what you want
[09:57] sa_: say how it help me please
[09:57] mauritslamers: there are two: node-mysql is one, there is also an adapter based on libmysqlclient
[09:57] sa_: i'll do web app
[09:57] mauritslamers: sa_: what kind of a web app?
[09:57] sa_: i download npm install mysql 
[09:57] ph^_ has joined the channel
[09:58] sa_: bussinss
[09:58] mauritslamers: sa_: ever looked at Sproutcore?
[09:58] mauritslamers: (for the web app?)
[09:58] sa_: no
[09:59] mauritslamers: if you are doing a business web app, you definitely should take a look at Sproutcore for building it, I wrote Thoth specifically for it
[10:00] hemo has joined the channel
[10:00] mauritslamers: Thoth comes with Thoth-SC, specific adapter for it, and it allows you to create the database on the server, the models in the application, and the rest is provided

[10:06] mauritslamers: the manual way :)
[10:06] mauritslamers: very, very useful
[10:06] sa_: i try 
[10:07] sa_: thanks alot for your device

[10:08] sa_: and if i want to learn node
[10:09] sa_: what also i do
[10:09] TomY has joined the channel
[10:09] bzinger has joined the channel
[10:09] mauritslamers: node is javascript, so learn javascript :)
[10:09] sa_: :D
[10:10] sa_: i know that
[10:10] mauritslamers: sa_: this might help: http://devmt.hku.nl/~sproutcore/doku.php?id=javascript:start
[10:10] sa_: but i mean how to know the relation between different modules
[10:11] sa_: there are alot of modules which serve node
[10:11] mauritslamers: sa_: every module is a namespace by itself
[10:12] sa_: hmmmmmmm
[10:12] mauritslamers: normally you would assign functions and objects to the always present exports object.
[10:12] sa_: for example
[10:13] Utkarsh__ has joined the channel
[10:13] sa_: i try to use mongodb so i use mongoose
[10:13] mlncn has joined the channel
[10:13] sa_: then i use mongodb-native
[10:13] sa_: what is the best
[10:13] sa_: i do not know
[10:13] mauritslamers: That depends on your preferences I think
[10:13] sa_: i was try to learn only
[10:14] sa_: so i cann't decided
[10:14] mauritslamers: Some modules are using bindings to the C or C++ libraries
[10:14] sa_: yes
[10:14] mauritslamers: others are JS-native implementations 
[10:14] sa_: i see that
[10:14] mauritslamers: I rather have JS-native implementations
[10:14] mauritslamers: because it is much more platform independent
[10:15] xmilliard has left the channel
[10:15] sa_: yes 
[10:16] mauritslamers: In my case (with Thoth) I want to be platform independent, but if you already know what kind of platform you will run on and you also know that won't change. the bindings version can also be a good idea

[10:17] sa_: mmmmmmmmmmm
[10:18] sa_: thanks for your advice
[10:18] mauritslamers: for me there is an additional reason to use JS-native stuff because it is always non-blocking
[10:19] mauritslamers: sa_: and for a server application that is rather important

[14:02] Kingdutch: For me to create a site to show off what I can do as a webdev (Site about me :') ) although seeing the changes in PHP 5.3 I'm seriously doubting if I should use PHP for this
[14:02] Kingdutch: And I can't host node on there =/
[14:03] Kingdutch: Although I think node would be suited better than PHP for my plans

[14:04] dewey_: Kingdutch: http://nodester.com/
[14:04] dewey_: or heroku
[14:04] Kingdutch: Yeh but I'm not rich
[14:04] Kingdutch: And I just paid wait waht
[14:04] floby: nothing fits in PHP they add features randomly following the hype
[14:04] dewey_: both free
[14:05] Kingdutch: Oh right
[14:05] Kingdutch: Wiat that's free hosting?
[14:05] Kingdutch: floby: I know... it was cool, but now it's just getting bloated and like, wTF*
[14:06] floby: Kingdutch: cool ? that must have been a long time ago. anyway before I started using it. I hated it the moment I touched it.
[14:07] erwe: wtf
[14:07] floby: Kingdutch: PHP has no plan. it is founded on no language theory. It's just a patchwork. wanna learn somthing cool ? learn Perl ^^
[14:07] erwe: i've got main.css on /
[14:07] erwe: and the jade layout on /views
[14:07] erwe: but I can't include the css file.. why's that?
[14:07] erwe: o.O
[14:08] floby: have you created your directory structure with the express utility ?
[14:08] Plouj: What's the difference between net.Server and net.Socket in terms of how I read data from the socket?
[14:08] erwe: floby: yes :|
[14:08] Kingdutch: floby: It used to be based on C++
[14:08] Plouj: does net.Server abstract/make something easier than just using net.Socket?
[14:09] floby: Kingdutch: Yes I know ^^ it has lost a lot of it though. it takes from perl too. the silly dollar sign for example
[14:09] Kingdutch: yeh I know
[14:09] floby: Plouj: Server listens on a port and creates a bidirectionnal socket when a net.Socket connects to that port
[14:09] Kingdutch: Somehow my 60 bucks feels misspend =/
[14:09] Kingdutch: Although I guess I might be able to transfer to a VPS
[14:09] Kingdutch: but then I'd have security issues as well
[14:10] floby: erwe: then you must have a 'public' folder.
[14:10] Plouj: floby: so net.Server is one step higher in the abstraction layer than a net.Socket?
[14:11] Kingdutch: Although imo, node.js (JavaScript) doesn't really lend itself to OOP (Well it does, but it has the prototype weirdness etc.) which lends itself less for the framework I want to make
[14:11] eee_c has joined the channel
[14:11] Kingdutch: So it's like choosing between the better of two evils
[14:11] floby: erwe: public/ is the root directory of your website for static files. So stylesheets go in public/stylesheets/ and your require them as /stylesheets/main.css
[14:12] Plouj: floby: if I want to write a script which receives data over a TCP socket, should I be using net.Socket? I don't see a way to "open" or listen on a socket.
[14:12] floby: Kingdutch: I wouldn't use node.js for a full website (again). It's painful by many aspects. It often simpler to do it the way you know. Like PHP or RoR
[14:12] Plouj: ACTION is looking at http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.1/api/all.html#net.Socket
[14:12] Kingdutch: floby: Right, I wish there was a way to create websites like normal applications
[14:13] Kingdutch: Where you didn't need to worry about client/server side, but just treat it as one
[14:13] Kingdutch: Like the language/framework will take care of what goes where
[14:13] pandeiro: floby: even with Express or something? you don't find it good for doing a website?
[14:13] floby: Plouj: Server doesn't have the same utility. Server is for computers that must be reachable by others. So a server allow INCOMING connections. Once the Server has given you a Socket to speak to the one who connected, it's the very same interface as Socket
[14:13] PyroStrex has joined the channel
[14:14] Plouj: floby: sounds like Server is what I want
[14:14] floby: pandeiro: Express is what is the closest to an acceptable framework. But it needs some work to be perfect. Love it though
[14:14] floby: Plouj: go for it
[14:15] PyroStrex: hmm... If i were to build a download requestor. how do I do so I can do something with the headers without losing any data?
[14:15] Plouj: when I do var server = net.createServer(function (c) {}, what type of object is c?
[14:15] floby: Kingdutch: I think that it is what GWT is about. Your program your whole thing in Java and it takes care of what goes in the client and what goes in the server
[14:15] PyroStrex: anyone?
[14:16] pandeiro: floby: any specific pain points with Express? I am still learning and somewhat platform agnostic at this point... did php (wordpress), django, now concentrating on couchdb and node
[14:16] Twelve-60: Plouj: stream
[14:16] floby: Plouj: net.Socket ! test it. createServer takes as an argument a listener for the connection event. But don't take my word for it. Please look at the doc
[14:16] Plouj: Twelve-60: actually, I just found this in the documentation: net.createServer(connectionListener)
[14:16] Plouj: floby: I'm asking you because I don't understand the documentation yet
[14:16] Kingdutch: floby: Looks interesting (I hate how google has made like everything I ever think of =/)
[14:17] Kingdutch: But I'll need to brush up on my Java skills, haven't touched it in a while
[14:17] Kingdutch: Are we at a point in web development yet where we can say, screw non-js users?
[14:17] arnorhs has joined the channel
[14:17] floby: pandeiro: I used express+mongoose+socket.io so the pain may have come from the simultaneous use of three immature projects ^^.
[14:18] floby: Kingdutch: never used it as I'm allergic to Java. but it looked very interesting
[14:18] sriley: Kingdutch: i dont think you should ever say that
[14:18] pandeiro: floby: yeah that is my early impression of node, generally... still pretty immature... almost every tutorial you find online that is more than 2 months old is obsolete in some way
[14:18] sriley: js is there to enhance not to provide function
[14:18] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[14:19] pandeiro: Kingdutch: while learning couchdb i basically reached that point... screw non-js users if you want to make a restful app
[14:19] floby: pandeiro: I use mainly less than 10 different libraries (I don't care about their dependecies) so I manage to keep track of what I use.
[14:19] Kingdutch: IMO JS is starting to be there to provide function, not enhance 
[14:19] Kingdutch: If I want to create a dynamic layout in PHP
[14:20] Kingdutch: I need something to get the browser info there
[14:20] jetienne: sriley: is there a legitimate reason to disable js in a browser ?
[14:20] Kingdutch: IMO desktop layouts are easier than web layouts
[14:20] slaskis: anyone got https://github.com/egorich239/node-compress to compile on solaris?
[14:20] floby: Plouj: it's alright to ask. but the type of the argument is clearly stated in the documentation.
[14:20] Kingdutch: Simply because you have more control over resolution and flow
[14:20] Kingdutch: (I mean I don't see a problem with an absolutely position layout on the web tbh)

[14:21] jetienne: floby: cool :)
[14:21] floby: erwe: you're welcome. It took me a little time to figure everything out in express as well
[14:21] sriley: jetienne: slow network connections, bad network connections, some accessibility (thinking motion related)
[14:22] jetienne: sriley: ? what is the relation with js and network connections ?
[14:22] floby: sriley: it really depends on the type of website you're building and the type of users you are going to get
[14:22] sriley: securtiy too, noscript is a damn popular addon for firefox
[14:22] jetienne: sriley: can you describe a security issue with js in a browser ?
[14:22] cyraxx: i have node + socket.io running right now, currently handling about 1100 connections with 10 new connections every second (and a lot of connections closing, too, there's a lot of fluctuation), using about 50MB memory and 1% CPU
[14:22] sriley: jetienne: if you have a slow network connection you might not want to download a 1-2mb javascript file
[14:23] cyraxx: before the update to 0.4.0 this used to run into some endless loop, using hundreds of megabytes of memory and 100% CPU
[14:23] floby: cyraxx: what are they sending/receiving ?
[14:23] jetienne: sriley: yep if you got slow connection, you want website to be light. but nothing to do with js tho. same apply to css/img/html
[14:23] sriley: xxs, clickjacking
[14:23] jetienne: sriley: ok so there are no security issue
[14:23] floby: sriley: oh that. that's what makes the internet so funny doesn't it ? :D
[14:24] Neil__ has joined the channel
[14:24] Kingdutch: sriley: xss, clickjacking is something a web dev should prevent
[14:24] nooob has joined the channel
[14:24] Kingdutch: Even if my site has no js, it could still be vulnerable to xss or clickjacking
[14:24] Kingdutch: So I can see why people cancel JS, but that means the web dev isn't doing his job
[14:25] cyraxx: floby: most of the time nothing (except keepalives), from time to time messages are published to groups of clients
[14:25] jetienne: i would be happy to know why they do
[14:25] pandeiro: Kingdutch: why do you think VPS is less secure?
[14:25] erwe: mongodb native or moongose?

[14:25] FireFly has joined the channel
[14:25] Kingdutch: Because in a VPS I have to do the security
[14:25] pandeiro: you said you considered switching to VPS but thought it would be less secure, above
[14:25] floby: erwe: depends on what you're gonna do
[14:25] Kingdutch: On the webhosting, if people get my data through a port other than 80 I can blame my webhost
[14:25] sriley: Kingdutch: everysite out that will at somepoint have an xss vulnerability

[14:26] Twelve-60: so uh... what was wrong with the old docs style :(
[14:26] Kingdutch: Put this at the top of your php scripts: $_GET = $_REQUEST = $_POST = $_FILES = null; :D
[14:27] Plouj: where is connectionListener documented? I'm not sure what functions are available in that class.
[14:27] floby: Twelve-60: I don't know. I liked them but you couldn't print them I guess
[14:27] Kingdutch: But it's coffee time, if you want to direct any messages at me, just nickalert me I'll read and reply in half an hour ;)
[14:27] Twelve-60: floby: should have a printable version then... lol
[14:27] sriley: even then you'll probably get stung at some point, for example in ie if you provide a malformed utf8 character you could escape a closing quote and inject attributes, just encoding didnt help for that
[14:27] Twelve-60: this style seems much harder to use...
[14:28] floby: Twelve-60: agreed
[14:28] Plouj: I didn't find much about connectionListener in http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.1/api/all.html
[14:28] erwe: floby: something which is similar to the mysql library on PHP.. 
[14:28] floby: Plouj: this is because events don't have this naming convention.. Wait a sec I'll point you to it
[14:29] floby: erwe: well use mysql then !
[14:29] erwe: floby: but i like mongodb :D
[14:29] erwe: mysql is too slow
[14:29] lukus has joined the channel
[14:29] squeeks: then your MySQL is poorly configured.
[14:30] erwe: well my sql server works fine.. but mongodb is faster anyway.. 
[14:30] floby: erwe: then mongoose is cool. You can specify some constraints on the data and even use the resulting classes as your Model classes. except you won't be able to serialize them
[14:30] erwe: mm k .. i'll use mongoose then.. ty
[14:30] floby: erwe: if you're looking for fast, you can try redis
[14:31] floby: Plouj: there you go
[14:31] boaz has joined the channel

[14:39] floby: Jourkey: Tim (who wrote step) says you shouldn't use it anymore if I recall well. the general feeling about flow control libraries on the mailing list is that you should write your own to fully understand what is going on
[14:39] erwe: that sucks :E
[14:40] floby: erwe: really ? I never used it so. but some simple things are also difficult to do with mongodb such as autoincrement, find a maximum and such
[14:40] Jourkey: floby: ok, interesting, thx
[14:42] erwe: floby: y.. i need a database that can handle a lot of connections without a really powerful hardware.. that's why I looked at mongodb :P

[14:48] gkatsev: and tj isn't here?
[14:49] gkatsev: so weird
[14:49] Plouj: ok, so I can read strings from a socket. Does that mean that underneath the hood, net.Socket waits buffers the data up to a newline or EOL or something before passing it to the function(data){...}?
[14:49] arpegius has joined the channel
[14:49] floby: it's based on connect... ?
[14:49] JamieD: i thought express was more like Sinatra?
[14:49] Plouj: where can I read about the underlying protocol of net.Socket
[14:50] Plouj: so far, I have this: http://fpaste.org/XjA4/
[14:50] dewey_: in the source code
[14:50] floby: Plouj: no it doesn't buffers lines. You have do this yourself or use the tiniest module in the world that I coded which is called `lines` on npm
[14:50] Plouj: floby: howcome that function(data){} is called every time I press RETURN in my telnet client?
[14:51] Plouj: floby: so if I type "blah blah blah<ENTER>" in telnet, the script prints: socket received data: blah blah blah<NEWLINE>
[14:51] Plouj: floby: how does net.Socket know when the client finished sending data?
[14:52] floby: Plouj: that's because you're no fast enough.
[14:52] Plouj: not fast for what?
[14:52] losing has joined the channel

[14:55] floby: Plouj: I don't know. just assume that you'll receive randomly mangled data and treat it as such. you can buffer it while waiting for a newline an call a function for each line for exaple
[14:57] Plouj: floby: ok, that's what I want to do, can I see  your example then?
[14:57] sriley: has anyone used the connect-auth module recently? cant seem to get it working even with the example app, failing authentication

[15:13] NuckingFuts: so it can't do shit
[15:14] Kingdutch: My biggest problem at the moment is the fact that, for display, you need HTML + CSS, to get server side interactivity, grab some ducttape slap anotehr layer on that (PHP and the like) to get client side functionality added to that, add javascript with some more ducttape, why do we need so many layers and different languages/data types?

[15:16] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: wrong again

[15:17] jopie: I stumbled into this discussion halfway, but is Kingdutch trying to say Node.js is useless? or what is the link to node
[15:17] Aikar: and how would you expect the web to work if they wasnt intertwined?
[15:17] Kingdutch: Doesn't make sense to me, use one slow language to generate three others, why not just stick with two
[15:17] bradleymeck: Mixing languages that are not explicitly domain specific is generally a bad idea

[15:18] jopie: some people still think they are...
[15:19] floby: Aikar: they had animated GIFs... those were good ol times
[15:19] NuckingFuts: Aikar: then we got static html + static JS
[15:19] Kingdutch: I'm saying we should have web dev more like desktop development, where the data is near the application (Just ike it is with PHP now) but the layout and what the layout does is near it too
[15:19] NuckingFuts: Now we have things like PHP --> HTML/CSS --> JS
[15:19] Kingdutch: Right now there's this massive gap between layout, it's functionality, and the server side with it's data
[15:19] jopie: coming back to today, does anybody have pointers on creating a modular node.js app that's testable?
[15:19] NuckingFuts: 3 layers
[15:19] Aikar: in order to have dynamic content, you need logic to dictate what content is rendered. thats where SSL (Server side languages) coimes in
[15:19] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: I assume it's a holdover from the classic model-view-controller layout.
[15:19] jopie: Kingdutch: look at Latex, you want to seperate out data/syntax and beautification/semantics
[15:20] bradleymeck: in one corner we have the people who want to make everything look the same even if it is different, in the other we have people who want to separate things in a way that they do not logically combine as to keep separation
[15:20] Kingdutch: Yes, but you also need logic drivign the client side. Why can't we have the logic for the client side and server side at one place =|
[15:20] Aikar: so you want drag and drop gui to build websites Kingdutch 
[15:20] Aikar: so go use ASP.NET
[15:20] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: *THEY'RE DIFFERENT THINGS*
[15:20] bradleymeck: aikar not what he is saying
[15:20] jopie: kingdutch: I write my php with views that have both view logic and JS in one file
[15:21] Aikar: Kingdutch> I'm saying we should have web dev more like desktop development, 
[15:21] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: Go grab JSPP, and have fun.
[15:21] Aikar: bradleymeck: sounds like it to me lol
[15:21] Kingdutch: NuckingFuts: But I don't see why they should be =/
[15:21] jopie: people have ported lots of php functions to js if that's what you wnat
[15:21] Kingdutch: Aikar: I don't use a drag and drop editor to create desktop apps, tyvm
[15:21] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: They require two entirely different styles.
[15:21] ph^ has joined the channel
[15:21] Kingdutch: Don't see how that is
[15:21] Kingdutch: I click a button -> Server request -> data from server -> display
[15:21] NuckingFuts: For one thing, server-side scripting has shown us that inline code is beautiful
[15:21] hornairs has joined the channel
[15:22] Aikar: Kingdutch: they cant be at the same side because you dont want your websites code to be publicly visible, the js layer dictates rich functionality of public elements
[15:22] floby: why not take the problem the other  way ? and stop developping desktop aps ?
[15:22] NuckingFuts: whereas client-side code tells us not to
[15:22] Aikar: sure you can build a site w/o js and do all the logic on the server side
[15:22] Aikar: your not required to use javascript
[15:22] dthompson has joined the channel
[15:22] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: How confusing would it be, to use two different forms of JS in one file?
[15:22] Aikar: Kingdutch: you can do that workflow you said above currently as is today
[15:23] Aikar: yuo dont HAVE to use javascript
[15:23] Kingdutch: Aikar: I could do an entire app in JS, problem is peopel would see all my database login data, making it useless, that's where web flaws come in and desktop apps differ, for a desktop app there's no, right click -> view source
[15:23] NuckingFuts: I'd imagine you could easily mix the two up
[15:23] bradleymeck: aikar he is mostly wanting to have the ability to have a language available for use on both server and client side. which double mvc has no complaints against, and if you think single mvc works for client + server w/ dynamic pages i would be interested in that discussion later. The fact is that people expect dynamicism
[15:23] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: Hence why I say that they NEED to be different languages
[15:23] Aikar: Kingdutch: except theres packet sniffers and decompilers and reverse engineering
[15:23] floby: Kingdutch: I can do it with mine although it's more complicated than a right click
[15:24] bradleymeck: nuckingfuts: language does not denote environment /headdesk
[15:24] Aikar: its just more technical on an app vs web
[15:24] Kingdutch: NuckingFuts: That's my point, the web today is flawed, because you NEEED different languages
[15:24] Kingdutch: ACTION goes off to make some sketches
[15:24] NuckingFuts: bradleymeck: I know, but what I'm saying is that if you use JS for both server AND client code IN THE SAME FILE, you're prone to accidentally mixing them up, sending server code to your client
[15:24] Aikar: you dont NEED, just each lang may serve a specific task better
[15:25] bradleymeck: nuckingfuts, you most likely shouldnt have them in the same file, and inline js is discouraged anyway for many reasons so i see no reason the server/client code would be in the same file
[15:26] bradleymeck: but i agree it would be a cluster if they were... ugg...
[15:26] NuckingFuts: bradleymeck: Agreed, but it would still be confusing, especially switching paradigms like that.
[15:26] NuckingFuts: I can instantly switch between PHP and JS, because they're so different that my mind clicks over
[15:26] bradleymeck: well possibly, but the paradigms dont really need to change at all, just available apis
[15:26] NuckingFuts: The $variable is enough to cause that :P

[15:28] bradleymeck: nuckingfuts im not sure what a template has to do w/ this?
[15:28] NuckingFuts: bradleymeck: It's not just a template, it's inline JS, PHP-style.
[15:28] bradleymeck: which i would argue is bad by design
[15:28] NuckingFuts: It seemed to execute somewhere between the server and client environments
[15:28] floby: NuckingFuts: Oh I see... I developped one of those.. never use it ^^
[15:29] floby: used*
[15:29] NuckingFuts: It had access to the window and such, which confounded me.
[15:29] stagas: SubStack++
[15:29] v8bot:  stagas has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 17 beers.
[15:29] Kingdutch: Something like such: The __call magic method is now invoked on access to private and protected methods.
[15:29] Kingdutch: Ugh >..

[15:30] stagas: SubStack: dnode is magic
[15:30] floby: Kingdutch: what is this ?
[15:30] bradleymeck: nuckingfuts, im not arguing that you should mix environments in the same place in the same language, the environments should provide means to separate out the logic between the 2, but both envs may use the same language, which would be a boon
[15:30] Kingdutch: It's how I see web vs desktop apps
[15:30] EyePulp has joined the channel
[15:30] NuckingFuts: floby: I'm quite tempted to make my own right now, actually.  A simpler setup, where it would change anything outside the <?js ?> sections into 'stream.write('escaped code')'
[15:30] Aikar: does node have support for the unknown method that simulates phps __call? and wish we had a magic method for __get and __set >:(
[15:30] Kingdutch: And the fact that I need to switch sides if I want to change the behaviour of a button
[15:30] Kingdutch: Whereas in a desktop app I wouldn't have to do this
[15:30] piscisaureus: mraleph: ping
[15:30] jmar777: I write applications where a web page (defined in HTML) makes requests (via JavaScript) to a Rest service (also coded in JavaScript [yay node!]), that in turn calls another Rest service coded in Java that invokes a SPARQL query, which returns data from a sesame repository.
[15:30] jmar777: if i had to do all that in the same language, i would shoot myself.
[15:31] bradleymeck: aikar, look up es-harmony proxy implementations
[15:31] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: Switch sides?  It's not that hard: You just click another tab/window in your editor
[15:31] floby: floby: mine is inspired by jsp. but is streamed. it's called blue and is on npm if you want to check it out
[15:31] Aikar: Kingdutch: heres the most simple answer to your debate that ends the discussion
[15:31] Aikar: THE WEB IS NOT A DESKTOP APPLICATION
[15:31] floby: yes
[15:31] Aikar: its not meant to be, and shouldnt ever be
[15:31] NuckingFuts: Aikar: Well phrased.
[15:31] bwinton: Aikar: You're new to the Internet, aren't you?  "ending" a discussion.  Hah!  ;)
[15:31] jmar777: or in the same environment/context/whatever. layered network stacks are the heart of the internet and web applications, and allow us encapsulate our different concerns

[15:31] floby: a desktop app is used by one person at a time
[15:32] floby: hundreds of millions of clients can connect to a server
[15:32] Kingdutch: Never did I say it should be >.> you're just single track minded at the moment, I try to explain, but w/e
[15:32] floby: and if you you make a desktop app that connect to a server you'll get the same gap between client and server code

[15:33] Kingdutch: MVC < ALL
[15:33] NuckingFuts: I'm pretty sure that that's similar to the PHP-HTML-JS model
[15:33] Aikar: Kingdutch: do you really like the idea of malware authors being able to write infected pages that you cant view source on? theres a seperation for a reason. code thats ran on your PC is meant to be visible, code thats ran on the server is not meant to be seen by you. theres a connection with 2 ends, not a single dot.
[15:33] jopie: even iPhone has MVC, how awesome does it have to be...
[15:33] Aikar: floby++ 
[15:33] v8bot:  Aikar has given a beer to floby. floby now has 1 beers.
[15:33] Aikar: exactly

[15:34] floby: Kingdutch, nobody does that anymore. that's why java applets failed
[15:34] Aikar: desktop all code = C# or w/e
[15:35] Aikar: web app code = HTML + JS + CSS
[15:35] Kingdutch: It's just, we're trying to make itneractive apps, with somethign that is designed to be standalone requests, that part just doesn't make sense to me

[15:35] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: The architecture of HTTP requires a server-client model.  IF you can find a way around it, please tell me.
[15:35] Kingdutch: NuckingFuts: Try a new protocol/architecture..
[15:35] jetienne: gbot2: silly bot
[15:35] Kingdutch: That was the point of this entire debate :')
[15:35] jopie: P2P HTTP with Socket.io?
[15:35] Kingdutch: But fine, we can move back to node.js
[15:35] floby: Kingdutch: yes, but javascript was even slower... but javascript got improved, not applets
[15:35] Aikar: why did all: trigger spidermonkey lol?
[15:35] fatjonny has joined the channel
[15:36] jmar777: Kingdutch: standalone requests? sounds like you're referring to a thin-client model, as opposed to having the browser be a thick-client
[15:36] NuckingFuts: floby: Not to mention JS stayed rather thin, while Java decided to bloat it up ;-)
[15:36] Aikar: all: var foo = 1;
[15:36] gbot2: Aikar: spidermonkey: undefined
[15:36] Kingdutch: jmar777: If I send all the content for my website over in one go and let JS decide what to display and what not to display, you're going to be waiting minutes for maybe 1 page view ...
[15:36] floby: jopie: thought of it and got bored out of the bittorrents specs
[15:36] Kingdutch: and seeign as I can't rely on JS, I'd need CSS to hide it all, and might have to resend it on a page chagne
[15:36] Kingdutch: change*
[15:36] NuckingFuts: jmar777: Google would love them :P
[15:36] jetienne: floby: i coded it for you :) http://webpeer.it
[15:36] jopie: floby: they are a pain, but it's hellishly complicated
[15:37] jmar777: Kingdutch: you don't need to send the whole application over. it can still be modular
[15:37] pair: does anybody know if there is a way with express to not have certain things logged?.. I can't figure out how to turn off logging based off a condition
[15:37] jetienne: http://webpeer.it is a merge between http and bittorrent protocols
[15:37] jetienne: ACTION is offtopic too now :)
[15:37] Aikar: sounds like web development just isnt for you Kingdutch 
[15:37] NuckingFuts: Aikar: Ain't that the truth?
[15:38] floby: ACTION checking out webpeer
[15:38] apoc: btw it would be really great to create a latest/stable symlink for the documentation: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/...
[15:38] Kingdutch: I suppose a node.js webserver would solve many problems a traditional webserver has in the fact that it could keep persistency, where you'd need e.g. PHP sessions to store data accross requests, and you can't just send a page update to the client
[15:38] jmar777: Kingdutch: read through Fielding's dissertation on REST. it's not the same REST you get when you google it, and it'll convince you that 95% of web sites are "doing it wrong"
[15:38] NuckingFuts: jetienne: lol @ shameless self-whoring :P
[15:38] Aikar: Kingdutch: if you relied on persistency in a server your doing it wrong
[15:38] floby: jmar777+
[15:38] Aikar: server could crash
[15:39] jetienne: floby: http://webpeer.it/blog/2010/08/24/webpeer-binding-for-nodejs/ to be more on topic. unfortunatly this is all for node 0.2 . cant find the time to port on 0.4
[15:39] Aikar: you still need to store it externally
[15:39] jopie: HTTP = stateless
[15:39] Aikar: unless the data is meant to be temp
[15:39] floby: my last year project was on REST
[15:39] jetienne: NuckingFuts: well this is cool as it is on topic :)
[15:39] Kingdutch: Aikar: You're trying to fit whatever I'm saying into the HTTP picture, which is not what I'm trying to do.. I'm talking about a new way to make websites, which goes away from the HTTP protocol.. but anyway I'll check out that resource jmar
[15:39] NuckingFuts: Aikar: Doesn't PHP's $_SESSION allow for persistent storage of variables on the user session?
[15:40] floby: jetienne: I think I already been on this page. is this some kind of CDN ?
[15:40] Aikar: NuckingFuts: it stores to disk
[15:40] mraleph: piscisaureus: pong
[15:40] Aikar: or optionally another storage mechanism
[15:40] NuckingFuts: Aikar: Thought so.
[15:40] jetienne: floby: yep it may be seen as a userdriven cdn
[15:40] Aikar: so you cant rely on $_SESSION if your servers are not configured correctly in a load balanced cluster
[15:40] piscisaureus: ah mr א
[15:40] floby: jetienne: slick!
[15:40] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: You cannot send data unless the client requests said data.
[15:41] piscisaureus: You think that build system patch will be looked at?
[15:41] Kingdutch: NuckingFuts: Yet we're all trying so desperately with javascript to do just that
[15:41] NuckingFuts: Kingdutch: Not really.
[15:41] Kingdutch: Look at long polling and the likes
[15:41] floby: jetienne: like freenet without the anarchist retards ? ^^ It's interesting
[15:41] bradleymeck: nuckingfuts that is somewhat untrue now days w/ comet/longpolling/websockets anywho
[15:41] jetienne: floby: i will refactor the website . to make it clearer and to update node.js binding 
[15:42] Aikar: Kingdutch: the rest of the world disagrees in that we dont need a new system like your describing. the current system is fine. our only issue is stupid backwards compatability, THATS the problem the web has.
[15:42] jetienne: floby: yep :)
[15:42] NuckingFuts: bradleymeck: Well, yes, but it still takes the client side to initiate said connection ;-)
[15:42] mraleph: piscisaureus: eventually.
[15:42] floby: jetienne: that goes Ctrl+D'd
[15:42] Kingdutch: Aikar: I disagree with the fact you're entitled to speak for the rest of the world, but w/e
[15:42] jetienne: floby: ctrl+d ?
[15:42] piscisaureus: ok. so issues are never "forgotten"?

[15:43] floby: jetienne: ^^ well... bookmarked
[15:43] jmar777: the biggest problem with HTTP is that people use it wrong. it's not a transport protocol, it's an application protocol, and therefore SHOULD imply application-level constraints. people don't understand HTTP though, and do things that violate those constraints
[15:43] Aikar: stuff like "client width/height" could be sent over HTTP headers
[15:43] NuckingFuts: Aikar: IE :P
[15:43] jetienne: floby: ah :)
[15:44] NuckingFuts: Aikar: Wouldn't that be wonderful? 8D

[15:44] Aikar: jmar777: saying "its not a transport protocol" when transport protocol is in its name is kinda weird :P
[15:44] Kingdutch: which is why I suggest to make sometihng new that reveals info like that
[15:44] Kingdutch: And it'd require different browsers
[15:44] Aikar: Kingdutch: it can be added today as is, recommend it to html5 spec or w/e
[15:45] trotter has joined the channel
[15:45] Aikar: that can be added to user agent string
[15:45] Kingdutch: So maybe HTTP would lend itself, just not the way the web is developed nowadays
[15:45] jopie: Anyone here use Mongoose with any kind of TTD?
[15:45] Aikar: but older browsers wont support it
[15:45] jmar777: Aikar: heh, i guess i meant to differentiate application LAYER from transport LAYER
[15:45] jopie: *TDD
[15:45] Aikar: i really need to get to work ;(
[15:45] pandeiro: Could some kind of Wave clone be done with node (and a db)?

[15:46] Aikar: Kingdutch: user agent header describes the users "agent", the agents width and height kinda makes sense to be in UA string

[15:47] floby: Wave server is open source, isn't it.
[15:47] floby: and works well
[15:47] sth: yup
[15:47] Kingdutch: Aikar: I don't really care _where_ it is, as long as the server can get the data
[15:47] NuckingFuts: floby: It is
[15:47] Aikar: but the suggestion would be denied anyways, as the server shouldnt be dictating rendering, and the browser could resize. doing stuff based on agent size should be done on the agent and not server
[15:47] NuckingFuts: floby: But it's in Java. Ruck.
[15:47] NuckingFuts: *Yuck
[15:48] Aikar: width and height are not useful for passing to server
[15:48] hunterloftis: ExpressjS - anybody else have trouble getting partials to reliably receive data? partial('account', { user: 'Dude' }) is telling me that account.user is undefined... this only seems to happen with nested partials
[15:48] floby: NuckingFuts: don't tell me about it... but if it works, then it's okay. just patch some hooks in it
[15:48] Kingdutch: Aikar: Why not?
[15:48] pandeiro: yeah wave server is open source but i think it uses xmpp?
[15:48] Aikar: hunterloftis: gotta do {locals: {user
[15:48] Kingdutch: They'd allow the server to calculate absolute positioned layouts
[15:48] coltrane has joined the channel
[15:48] Aikar: Kingdutch: thats something CSS is meant to do
[15:48] hunterloftis: Aikar: Ah, so "locals" was removed from template rendering, but not from partials rendering?
[15:48] Kingdutch: Which currently aren't possible seeing as if someone has a small screen and no js to edit the layout, and absolute positioned layout would fail
[15:48] Kingdutch: Unless you make it fluid, which doesn't always look good
[15:48] Aikar: hunterloftis: oh, i dunno about that. i havent used it in a while
[15:49] Aikar: Kingdutch: trying to support the web on old 'dumbphones' is a completely different subject...
[15:49] jmar777: Kingdutch: if the width/height was relevant to the response media, you could always use an Accept header
[15:49] warz has joined the channel
[15:49] hunterloftis: Aikar: thanks for the suggestion, just tried it though and even with locals it fails
[15:49] Aikar: and you can do css positioning w/o js
[15:49] Kingdutch: Aikar: Wasn't it you who said we should support non-js browsers?
[15:50] mgc has joined the channel
[15:50] jmar777: Kingdutch: either way though, sounds like a presentation concern, which belongs in the application logic, which should ideally therefore be handled by the browser as a thick-client
[15:50] Aikar: i do think that yes, but in the sense you shouldnt rely on js unless the site is heavy js based. but layout is not something that needs to be done with js
[15:50] Kingdutch: No we could do it with CSS
[15:51] Kingdutch: however, CSS doesn't really allow for complex layouts that work accross sizes of 300x330 to 2000x2000
[15:51] Kingdutch: Unless you make it static or fluid
[15:52] joeshaw___ has joined the channel
[15:52] Aikar: if you need js to render your site, you use a <noscript> please enable js</noscript> tag
[15:52] jmar777: noticing a couple actual #node.js questions going unanswered. perhaps this convo should temporarily move to #node.js-ot?
[15:52] Kingdutch: And you can't change from static to fluid based on browser dimensions ( I guess you could with min-width, max-width etc. but even then, knowing the dimensions before you send a layout to the client to display, you could do some stuff you can't do with css alone)
[15:52] Aikar: only browsers that legitly dont support js are old dumbphones, which you wont have a rich site layout for anyways
[15:52] Aikar: im done with the convo, i gotta work lol

[15:55] mraleph: gattuso: this is not possible.
[15:55] gattuso: nor with --expose-gc option?
[15:55] jmar777: Utkarsh_: var res = http.get(...)
[15:56] jopie: now we're on the topic of node.js again, anyone have pointers (blogs, tutorials, vids, brilliant ideas) for Mongoose and TDD? or TDD in general. This callback spaghetti is leaving me very lost…
[15:56] floby: mraleph: it is if you put your hands in C++ I think
[15:56] mraleph: gattuso: expose-gc just gives you a function to invoke GC.
[15:56] gattuso: or with some debugging option?
[15:56] floby: jopie: I was planning on using TDD last time I used mongoose. but in the end I spent most of my time in the REPL fooling around
[15:56] mraleph: gattuso: why you need this? you can look at the generated code.
[15:57] gattuso: when i create a = 2 & b = 2; a & b point to the same variable?
[15:57] JulioBarros has joined the channel
[15:57] jmar777: Utkarsh_: in the callback you pass to get, do this: var body = '';  res.on('data', function (chunk) { body += chunk; });

[15:57] floby: gattuso: no they don't
[15:57] Yuffster has joined the channel
[15:57] Utkarsh_: jmar777, ah, so there's no simpler way to get the whole response at once?
[15:57] floby: gattuso: all vars in JS are references except when the type is Boolean, Number or String
[15:57] mraleph: gattuso: variables are places, you can't point to them. you can point to values.
[15:58] Tobsn has joined the channel
[15:58] bingomanatee: jopie: while callbacks are in the nature of node, they need not be as anonyous as is current practice. I often name and seperate my callbacks out to clarify code. 
[15:58] jmar777: Utkarsh_: you could easily create a convenience wrapper for that. but by default, http.get doesn't know if it's discrete response or streaming
[15:58] gattuso: then the === operator what is good for?
[15:59] bingomanatee: You can use the module system to further organize nested callbacks - but if callbacks as such aren't your thing then node is probably not going to be an enjoyable experience for you. 
[15:59] floby: gattuso: check that two vars are of the same value & same type.
[15:59] bingomanatee: BTW what is TDD?
[15:59] FireFly|n900: gattuso, it compares types
[15:59] mraleph: gattuso: to do a strict comparison without implicit type coercions.

[16:02] floby: bingomanatee: write your tests in separates programs allows them to be used programmatically. For exemple with git bisect
[16:02] venom00ut: ehi there gattuso

[16:02] gattuso: ehi venom00ut 
[16:02] bingomanatee: I have gotten mongoose to work on a basic level recently. You do of course have to put the unit test comparison in a callback - if you try to get the return value of most node functions, well, there isn't any - the return value is passed to a callback. 
[16:02] floby: mraleph: I didn't say they should :D
[16:02] colinsullivan: I am new to node, and am looking at a socket.io example where at the top of an HTML file there is ``<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js" >``.  Which mechanism is allowing the browser to load this file?
[16:03] colinsullivan: I don't see anything in the server about it except for ``io = require('socket.io')``
[16:03] jmar777: Utkarsh_: no problem. mikeal's stuff is generally good, so i'd imagine it's a good reference (haven't dug through it myself, though)

[16:57] Plouj: squeeks: that would tell me what type it is, but how do I force data to created as a Buffer type

[17:23] bubbafat_: Does it work for a while and the  stop working?
[17:23] gnagno: yes, it stops working with "too many open files"
[17:23] bubbafat_: Should you be calling destroySoon?
[17:24] bubbafat_: And have you looked at a module like node-paperboy?
[17:24] squeeks: crazy idea: I wonder if you can get rails to log to a UDP socket instead, then just get node to listen and push the messages down
[17:24] gnagno: bubbafat_: what is destroySoon?
[17:25] gnagno: squeeks: I would like not to modify RoR code, so I can release my code on github and people can use it for different purposes

[17:26] squeeks: gnagno: again, crazy idea
[17:26] gnagno: bubbafat_: isn't it getting collected by the garbage collector?

[17:48] clarkfischer has joined the channel
[17:48] jmar777: gnagno: my guess is that you need to do some queuing. client polls, RoR updates file, you flush response. RoR updates file a few more times, and THEN client begins next request, causing missed lines
[17:49] xandrews has joined the channel
[17:49] JamieD: nook: that works, I get an array of users. having trouble finding any decent documentation on querying using mongoose
[17:49] jmar777: gnagno: fwiw, socket.io will do that for you transparently. otherwise you need some control mechanism between the client and the server (e.g., last line received)
[17:50] adrian_berg has joined the channel
[17:50] nook: JamieD Documentation of mongoose is indeed crappy

[17:53] jmar777: gnagno: have your client initiate a connection, and do a socket.send(...) in your fs data listener
[17:53] RXpants has joined the channel
[17:55] jmar777: gnagno: e.g., the code currently in your createServer callback should be in a .on('message') callback. that message would be something like "tail: <path>", or whatever handshake you want
[17:55] gnagno: jmar777: what about the part concerning the queuing the data?
[17:56] jmar777: gnagno: you won't need to worry about doing that manually with socket.io. if you're going to do it the current way though you have to be sure that you account for new logs that were observed in between client "polling" requests
[17:56] jmar777: gnagno: you might want to also end the connection explicitly after 30 seconds or so, to prevent timeout disconnects
[17:57] gnagno: jmar777: thank you for your suggestions I will try to move to socket.io now, will get back to tell you if I have any good new :)
[17:57] jmar777: gnagno: good luck :)

[17:57] jstritar has joined the channel
[17:57] jmar777: gnagno: don't worry about killing the connection if you're using socket.io though. that's why we use it - it handles all that stuff for you
[17:57] gnagno: jmar777: do you think my idea can be interesting anyway? I want to do something useful for the comunity

[18:00] jmar777: gnagno: definitely sounds nice. i could easily imagine myself using something like that for remote-server monitoring (http authentication would be a plus!)
[18:00] gnagno: jmar777: you know when you have a long log file and you have to read all along to find just the specific portion you're looking for? I want to add some controls to filter out the data and help the readability of the log file

[18:24] tjholowaychuk: nook: most of us have jobs, and are busy writing libs, docs will surely come, but it may take some time
[18:24] Aikar: if mongoose docs arnt suffecient for you, try a different database system, cause your not going to find better for mongo
[18:24] shaver: otherwise you're just saying "it is imperfect", which isn't really actionable
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: hell I have pretty extensive docs for express but people still complain
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: its never done
[18:25] nook: tjholowaychuk express got good documentation
[18:25] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: those docs are great
[18:25] dthompson has joined the channel
[18:25] Aikar: im fairly impressed with mongooses docs now im looking at em
[18:25] ncb000gt: comparatively
[18:25] nook: mongoose on the opposite side, do not have that
[18:25] Aikar: better doced than alot of things
[18:25] nook: If express is yours, then you don't need any other advices on how documenting code. You have the way.
[18:26] Aikar: maybe you just dont know how to read or interact with documentation. is javascript enabled on your browser?
[18:26] Aikar: click on a word, it expands to tons of info
[18:26] ncb000gt: also, it seems that tjholowaychuk made another tool i'll be using
[18:26] ncb000gt: Dox
[18:26] ncb000gt: :)
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: nook: yeah, but it takes a lot of time
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: dox
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: is such a hack

[18:27] Aikar: nook: well thanks for showing me that mongoose has good docs now. when i first looked at it i never expanded api.html, this is really good
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: just warning, it is really picky. the comment "parser" is super specific to my projects (every block of code commented)
[18:27] Aikar: dunno why you dont find it good
[18:27] nook: Aikar how can i customize collection name, go.
[18:27] nook: You have 5 minutes to find that in docs.
[18:28] Aikar: to rename a collection?
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: its hard to read IMO, I thought the annotated source thing was neat at first
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: but
[18:28] EyePulp: this is typical for platforms in early stages.  the only people who know the stuff well enough to doc it are the people building it, and there's so much crap to build and debug that docs are a secondary priority.  it's not evil, it's just reality at this stage.
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: i find it annoying
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:28] nook: To set up a custom collection name for model.
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: ill write something better eventually
[18:28] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: I'll modify it if needed...or I'll look at your documentation and complain about it
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: :D
[18:28] bwinton: tjholowaychuk: I would appreciate an example in express showing how to set up static routing for everything that's not explicitly routed elsewhere.
[18:29] Aikar: nook: Click Model -> Model.collection "Collection the model uses."
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: bwinton: not sure what you mean
[18:29] EyePulp: a wildcard route?
[18:29] ncb000gt: bwinton: there is a static provider that is shown in the configuration
[18:29] EyePulp: that's called 404
[18:29] ncb000gt: EyePulp: lol
[18:29] EyePulp: =)
[18:29] nook: Aikar you're already wrong
[18:29] nook: Because it's not there
[18:30] isaacs has joined the channel
[18:30] nook: It's getting specified in "index"
[18:30] hij1nx has joined the channel
[18:30] bwinton: I've seen the static provider, and that's what I want, but I'm unclear as to how it will react with the other routes I specify.
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: bwinton: the middleware are use()ed in order of precedence
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: so
[18:30] bwinton: So it matters where I add the static provider?
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: if you have the static provider first
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: above your routes if you do GET /style.css your routes *cannot* respond to that request
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: since staticProvider is an end-point unless it 404s
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: bwinton: yeah, it matters where you put anything
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: its like lego
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: you just build what you need
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: but people do seem to get confused that you actually have to think about order
[18:32] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: i guess that kind of answers the question though, probably need an example then :)
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: yup
[18:32] ncb000gt: erm, not example, explanation
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: sucks because a lot of the express docs really belong in connect
[18:32] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: any idea when the new connect will be done?
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: but people dont look at the connect stuf often when using express
[18:32] bwinton: tjholowaychuk: Right.  So I need to add all my app.get()s and then app.use(staticProvider).  (Which is what I did, but I wasn't sure, and none of the examples had both app.get and app.use.)
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: day or two
[18:32] ncb000gt: also, is it going to be part of senchalabs again?
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: yeah ill merge back
[18:33] ncb000gt: gotcha, ok cool
[18:33] Aikar: i agree the docs could use some visual updates to help seperate out stuff and an always accessible TOC, but the content of the docs looks great. now if your complaining that something is missing, stop bitching and file a report to the author
[18:33] Aikar: and if the author isnt responding, #node.js isnt the proper place to gripe about it

[18:36] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: you should create an awesome new node project that consists entirely of detailed docs, and no actual code.
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: I want to doc inline, but yeah I dont care about the code being there really
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: not side-by-side at least
[18:37] EyePulp: Just make up methods and features, write them up, and never write a single line of code.
[18:37] ncb000gt: EyePulp: only if it consists purely of "RA RA OH LA LA..."
[18:38] EyePulp: ncb000gt: I don't understand your strange chants.  He's a Witch!
[18:38] Aikar: nook: according, to docs, you call mongoose.model(schema, 'customcollectionname');

[18:38] jacksonmills has left the channel

[18:41] tjholowaychuk: jeromegn: it could
[18:41] ncb000gt: isaacs: does that patch somehow inform the use that something went wrong?
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: but im not goign to say how :)
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:41] jeromegn: :o
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: be adventurous!
[18:41] ncb000gt: oh i see, it throws if it catches and err
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: :D
[18:41] ncb000gt: yea, that'd be useful
[18:41] tjholowaychuk: jeromegn: sorry i woudl help, just no time
[18:41] isaacs: ncb000gt: it just prevents the thing from being cached.
[18:42] ncb000gt: yea sure
[18:42] isaacs: ncb000gt: so let's say you have foo.js which is "throw blah"
[18:42] ncb000gt: looks great
[18:42] isaacs: ncb000gt: then require("foo") throws, and require("foo") again throws again
[18:42] jeromegn: tjholowaychuk: np, it's not a show-stopper yet
[18:42] isaacs: ncb000gt: instead of returning a blank object the second time
[18:42] ncb000gt: isaacs: yep
[18:42] isaacs: ncb000gt: but you still need to cache it until it throws, so that cycles are handled.
[18:43] ncb000gt: isaacs: mmhmm

[18:58] joeshaw: Bonuspunkt: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/FAQ
[18:58] joeshaw: The official name of Node is "Node". The unofficial name is "Node.js" to disambiguate it from other nodes.
[18:58] lukegalea: datapimp: I've considered that.. but I really don't mind javascript other than the rough context switch when polyglotting.. But I'll give it a go and see how I like it. Thanks.

[19:04] ncb000gt: and that's a pita too
[19:04] ncb000gt: since it compiles down to JS, the JS is generated
[19:05] ncb000gt: but debugging tools wont tell you what line of coffeescript the problem was on
[19:05] ncb000gt: so you need to reverse it back to coffeescript in order to fix

[20:04] mgc has joined the channel
[20:04] isaacs: eventualbuddha: that should just print the version
[20:04] isaacs: let's see if it can do *anything*
[20:04] isaacs: eventualbuddha: or node cli.js config ls
[20:05] eventualbuddha: isaacs: updated the gist: https://gist.github.com/8bcdd62a1b553a6241c3
[20:05] Plouj: do I call buffer.copy(targetBuffer, targetStart=0, sourceStart=0, sourceEnd=buffer.length) on the targetBuffer object?
[20:05] isaacs: eventualbuddha: ok.  here we go!
[20:05] Plouj: or is it to be called on the global Buffer object?
[20:05] isaacs: eventualbuddha: you have a very old version of node, it seems

[20:05] isaacs: eventualbuddha: and also, not teh most up to date npm source code.
[20:05] isaacs: brianc: what's up?
[20:06] joeshaw___ has joined the channel
[20:06] isaacs: eventualbuddha: not sure why it's showing 0.2.13-3.  That's very old.  it should be 0.3.7 or so
[20:06] eventualbuddha: isaacs: it's possible there's a version of node somewhere on my machine that's bad
[20:06] isaacs: eventualbuddha: `which node`
[20:06] eventualbuddha: isaacs: /usr/local/bin/node
[20:06] isaacs: eventualbuddha: compare that wiht `sudo which node`

[20:08] brianc: isaacs: currently have a pure js postgres client named 'pg' on npm. working on libpq c++ bindings in the same project (to reuse integration tests) would like to be able to 'npm install pg' and then you can do "require('pg')" for the pure javascript & "require('pg-native')" for the libpq native bindings.  Is this possible?
[20:08] eventualbuddha: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/8bcdd62a1b553a6241c3#file_gistfile3.txt
[20:08] isaacs: brianc: sure, just make them two separate packages.
[20:09] isaacs: brianc: each with a "main" module defined
[20:09] aheckmann has joined the channel
[20:09] isaacs: brianc: if you want them to always be installed together, you can have them depend on one another
[20:09] eventualbuddha: isaacs: HEAD of the npm repo I have checked out is a commit (313f2632) from you, today, "Don't try to install cwd inside bundle"
[20:09] isaacs: eventualbuddha: ok.  that's the latest.
[20:09] isaacs: eventualbuddha: so... why does node cli.js -v show 0.2.13-3?
[20:10] isaacs: eventualbuddha: that's so strange.
[20:10] isaacs: eventualbuddha: maybe can you try `locate npm.js`?  see if that shows you any weird hiding places?
[20:10] isaacs: eventualbuddha: if that command fails,try `find /usr/local/ -name npm.js`
[20:10] eventualbuddha: isaacs: in case it matters: https://gist.github.com/8bcdd62a1b553a6241c3#file_gistfile4.txt
[20:11] isaacs: eventualbuddha: oh, crazy
[20:11] isaacs: what's /usr/bin/node -v?
[20:11] isaacs: i wonder if it's picking that one up or something
[20:11] eventualbuddha: v0.4.1 :)
[20:12] eventualbuddha: but it looks like I have /usr/local/node-0.2.{2,6}
[20:12] eventualbuddha: I'll try deleting those
[20:12] isaacs: ok..
[20:12] squeeks: eventualbuddha: before you hose it, check "which node" is pointing at 0.4.1
[20:12] eventualbuddha: this machine is so crufty...
[20:12] eventualbuddha: it is (was)
[20:13] eventualbuddha: I ought to just start with a fresh install of OS X
[20:13] eventualbuddha: this one has moved migrated from three machines back

[20:15] isaacs: eventualbuddha: wow.  you sure do like programs!
[20:15] eventualbuddha: I think it's finally confused beyond repair
[20:15] brianc: isaacs: awesome. mucahs gracias. something like this? https://gist.github.com/841089
[20:15] eventualbuddha: isaacs: sadly killing those old nodes didn't fix it

[20:20] isaacs: creationix: self destruct?  what's that do?
[20:20] creationix: sometimes I have a global npm that gets in the way of local npm installs
[20:20] isaacs: creationix: like a "scorch the earth and leave it bare"?
[20:21] creationix: isaacs: almost, bt not quite
[20:21] doki_pen: also, is there a more idiomatic way to say: var returl = Hash(defaults).merge(url.parse(urlstr)).end
[20:21] isaacs: eventualbuddha: try getting rid of those, maybe?
[20:21] eventualbuddha: isaacs: sadly killing those symlinks doesn't help either. if you've had enough I wouldn't blame you for giving up :)
[20:21] creationix: maybe not a self destruct, but a way to keep my global npm pure and clean and updated, but only install packages into my local node environments
[20:21] Sebmaster: piscisauerus: Did your cygwin port of v8 get merged?

[20:24] creationix: isaacs: true
[20:24] isaacs: doki_pen: yeah, that method is good
[20:24] creationix: what if there was a config to specify the root for certain packages
[20:24] creationix: or is that too magical
[20:24] isaacs: creationix: or clear the nvm stuff and do npm i npm, and then go back into nvm

[20:25] doki_pen: or are people trying to "inherit" packages
[20:26] creationix: doki_pen: no, it's just a neat feature of npm, where it auto-detects the node path based on the value of `which node`
[20:26] isaacs: doki_pen: that's exactly what i do with nave.  i have a separate world for each version of node
[20:26] squeeks: isaacs: QUESTION TIME: has the npm API changed recently since you last updated the README?

[20:28] creationix: is it possible to compile node with real readline support
[20:28] creationix: ignoring gpl issues for a moment
[20:29] eventualbuddha: isaacs: I somehow had a lib/ and share/ that had old node stuff in them that it was finding
[20:29] squeeks: creationix: GPL issues only arise if you start sharing.
[20:30] eventualbuddha: isaacs: then "node cli.js -v" reported 0.3.7
[20:30] doki_pen: so createClient is causing the error, why doesn't the catch() catch it?
[20:30] isaacs: eventualbuddha: i do not know how that was happening.  but it should be working now, i hope, yes?
[20:31] eventualbuddha: isaacs: well, it's still hanging. but it's outputting stuff with -ddd now
[20:31] eventualbuddha: I'll paste
[20:31] isaacs: eventualbuddha: hooray!
[20:31] creationix: squeeks: gpl was the reason that readline wasn't allowed into node
[20:31] creationix: not in the default distribution at least
[20:31] squeeks: creationix: yes but if you build it yourself and don't give it out, nobody is none the wiser
[20:31] creationix: I'm pretty sure linking against gpl software infects you
[20:32] eventualbuddha: isaacs: and yeah, totally not your fault. I have no idea how I messed it up like that but I'm sure I did something wrong

[20:32] creationix: anyway, like I said, ignoring the gpl mess, how do you compile in readline technically?
[20:32] doki_pen: try {require('http')createClient(80, 'lzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzkasjdf.com', false).request('GET', '/')}catch(e){console.log(e)}  anyone understand that?  Is it firing the exception in another thread?
[20:33] shaver: there's an editline distribution
[20:33] creationix: doki_pen: welcome to js
[20:33] shaver: we use it with the JS shell
[20:33] shaver: er, the spidermonkey shell
[20:33] eventualbuddha: doki_pen: .request() isn't synchronous, afaik
[20:33] creationix: shaver: yeah, that was mentioned too, I don't remember why it wasn't used
[20:33] francescop has joined the channel
[20:33] doki_pen: eventualbuddha: so how do people catch the exception?
[20:33] creationix: doki_pen: basically try..catch doesn't work across callbacks
[20:33] creationix: it's a "feature" of the language
[20:34] markwubben has joined the channel
[20:34] doki_pen: yeah, I understand.  what is the method of catching it?  am I missing a callback or somethign?
[20:34] shaver: it's a feature of the architecture
[20:34] eventualbuddha: doki_pen: I'm not the right person to ask, but usually either you have a callback that takes an error object
[20:34] francescop has left the channel
[20:34] shaver: ACTION doesn't know of anything that has lexical catch blocks affect escaped closures
[20:34] doki_pen: I'll try RTFM
[20:34] eventualbuddha: or I suppose you could register the uncaughtException handler, but I think that's wrong, so don't do it :)
[20:35] isaacs: doki_pen: require("http").request(confObject, function (res) { ... }).on("error", function (er) { handle it })
[20:35] eventualbuddha: that looks better :)
[20:36] isaacs: the correct way of handling it is to listen to the error event.
[20:36] shaver: the meta-correct way is to listen to isaacs
[20:36] doki_pen: isaacs: thanks a bunch

[20:37] eventualbuddha: isaacs: so do you think it's using the wrong tar or something?
[20:37] isaacs: doki_pen: prior to 0.3.7, you had to do the require("http").createClient(host, port).request(method, path, etc
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: creationix: was it nstore that does ENOENT on a failed get() ?
[20:38] doki_pen: isaacs: can I still do .on('error') with 0.3.7.  I only ask because one of my dev boxes is on 0.3.x
[20:38] doki_pen: so I've been trying to keep it backwards
[20:38] isaacs: eventualbuddha: i'm kind of stumped.  maybe it's a permission thing?  you've tried with both sudo and your user account?  what's `ls -laF /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/.cache/npm/0.3.7`?
[20:38] m4r00p has left the channel

[20:40] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Gotcha. We're on 1.0.0, but it seems to have some partials bugs (with nested partials / local variables), so I'm considering whether or not I should upgrade to master
[20:40] eventualbuddha: isaacs: that cache file didn't exist, and the cache clean didn't help :\
[20:40] davidc_ has joined the channel
[20:40] isaacs: eventualbuddha: it should exist once you try again

[20:42] isaacs: HAHAHAHH!!

[20:42] isaacs: oh, man, that is so bizarre.

[20:43] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: I will try and get better nesting coverage for 2.0
[20:43] isaacs: eventualbuddha: no wonder it's getting confused
[20:43] isaacs: eventualbuddha: this is why we removed npm from the homebrew index.
[20:43] eventualbuddha: isaacs: yeah
[20:43] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Thanks, everything else has been working brilliantly
[20:43] eventualbuddha: it seems like a bad idea
[20:43] isaacs: eventualbuddha: because the bugs aren't simple, or even immediate.  they're like little time bombs waiting to pop out and make work for us weeks or months later
[20:43] doki_pen: sweet, try {require('http')createClient(80, 'lzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzkasjdf.com', false).on('error',function(e){console.log(e)}).request('GET', '/')}catch(e){console.log(e)}
[20:43] eventualbuddha: isaacs: kinda like having rubygems in homebrew
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: cool man :)
[20:44] isaacs: doki_pen: you don't need the try/catch
[20:44] isaacs: doki_pen: it catches nothing
[20:44] shaver: not even the syntax error
[20:45] samcday: ^
[20:45] eventualbuddha: isaacs: and with that, npm is installed and runs

[20:48] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: the changes are pretty minimal, but meh gotta get it out
[20:48] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: minimal changes are good, the thing works pretty well
[20:49] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: But I've tried about every variation on ...   != partial('../components/account', {object: {user: {type:'member'}}, as: 'account'})    ... and account.user is always undefined when it's nested.
[20:49] possibilities has joined the channel
[20:49] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: you may have already fixed this issue, but when I drop in master I get some funky behavior, I think some of my other stuff is incompatible

[20:49] joeshaw: hmm
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: hmm, partial('componens/account', accountObject) should be enough
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: ill have a migration guide
[20:50] joeshaw: when is the C++ EventEmitter::Emit function used versus the JS emit() in events.js?
[20:50] joeshaw: is it just for native modules?
[20:50] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yep, that's what I tried first  ... != partial('../components/account', {user: {type:'member'}})
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: yup if that does not give you 'account' its a bug
[20:50] hunterloftis: (except with real data, I'm just tossing in object literals to be sure there's nothing else going on)
[20:51] joeshaw: also it'd seem as though the C++ one handles exceptions whereas the JS one doesn't; would an exception thrown by one listener completely prevent other listeners from being fired?

[21:04] tjholowaychuk: ahaha
[21:04] ryah: tjholowaychuk: you're getting a batch of fresh mission minis when 2.0 is done 
[21:04] creationix: mmmm, cupcakes
[21:04] halfhalo: yup
[21:05] ryah: well - maybe not fresh :)
[21:05] tjholowaychuk: haha, mmm stale cupcakes
[21:05] ryah: overnight
[21:05] ncb000gt: haha
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: ryah: started a day or two ago but mostof the work has been in connect

[21:10] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: yeah, it sucks. people can take te old stuff and plop it in a module if they want
[21:10] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: sure
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: added a few, removed a few
[21:10] ncb000gt: yea, i noticed

[21:14] devdazed: hi all what is the difference between doing this:  var Server = function(foo){} and this: var Server = function Server(foo){} ? 
[21:15] pandeiro__ has joined the channel
[21:15] wadey: if you do new Server(), the objects will have a .name === 'Server' with the first way
[21:15] wadey: err, the second way
[21:16] devdazed: ah, thanks@
[21:16] creationix: wadey: the instances won't will they?
[21:16] creationix: just the function
[21:16] creationix: devdazed: basically it names functions
[21:16] wadey: v8: var Server = function(foo){}; (new Server()).name
[21:16] v8bot: wadey: undefined
[21:16] wadey: var Server = function Server(foo){}; (new Server()).name
[21:16] creationix: which gives them .name and a name in stack traces
[21:16] wadey: v8: var Server = function Server(foo){}; (new Server()).name
[21:16] v8bot: wadey: undefined
[21:17] ajcates has joined the channel
[21:17] wadey: sorry, not the object, the constructor has .name
[21:17] wadey: ACTION is a little tired
[21:17] creationix: right :)
[21:17] devdazed: creationix: thats helpful!
[21:17] sugardave_work has joined the channel
[21:17] jmar777: devdazed: that second one is basically the same as: function Server(foo) {}; (no need for the var Server =)
[21:17] daveluke has joined the channel
[21:18] creationix: sometimes you're putting a function on a property and you don't want a local variable too, then it makes sense to name both the property and the function
[21:18] jmar777: devdazed: i guess only difference is that, since it's an assignment, the function isn't created until it's evaluated, whereas minus the assignment it's created at parse time
[21:18] creationix: remember that all variables and properties in javascript are just references.  The object they point to has no way of knowing what all points to it
[21:18] devdazed: jmar777: the reason i asked was because I see it a lot in tjholowaychuk's code as well as others
[21:18] jmar777: creationix: right..but var Server will be in the same scope as function Server. if it was bar.server, then totally agree
[21:18] wadey: v8: var F1 = function(){}; function F2(){}; [F1.name, F2.name]
[21:18] v8bot: wadey: ["", "F2"]
[21:18] wadey: there is a better example ^
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: what?
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: ?
[21:19] creationix: tjholowaychuk: you name you functions right?
[21:19] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: sorry, didnt mean to ping you
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: creationix: not all the time no
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: you dont need to
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: var foo = function(){} will show foo in the stack trace
[21:19] spetrea-home has joined the channel
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: so unless you want foo.name == 'foo' there is no point
[21:19] creationix: true, the v8 stack trace does all sorts of magic to try to guess names
[21:20] dspree has joined the channel
[21:20] dspree has joined the channel
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: yup
[21:20] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: i just started noticing you did it in express
[21:20] creationix: like *all sorts* of magic
[21:20] devdazed: what was the primary reasoningbehind that?
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: i raed v8's parser / ast optimizer thing on the plane the one time so I noticed that
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: read*
[21:20] creationix: back before v8 guessed names, it was the only way to get names in stack traces
[21:20] devdazed: i see
[21:21] creationix: and it's still good practice if you're going to introspect things and find out the name of the constructor
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: you want to when you do say module.exports = function session(){
[21:21] jmar777: devdazed: there is potential value in something like var obj = { myServer: function Server(foo) {} }; // obj.myServer.name === Server
[21:21] jmar777: devdazed: but var Server = function Server(...) is kind of pointless.  it redundantly defines Server in the current scope
[21:22] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: would var Server = module.exports = function(){} work?
[21:22] creationix: jmar777: right, the end effect is the same as if there was no "var Server = " there at all
[21:22] creationix: more or less
[21:22] devdazed: or it has to be var Server = module.exports = function Server(){}?
[21:22] jmar777: creationix: right
[21:22] Evet has joined the channel
[21:22] Evet has joined the channel
[21:22] creationix: devdazed: I'm not sure which v8 will use for the name in that case
[21:23] jmar777: creationix: and the only difference between function Server(...) and var Server = function (...) is that you get a name property, which you'll probably never need
[21:23] creationix: better to name it explicitly
[21:23] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:23] creationix: best to understand what's going on and decide for yourself
[21:23] jmar777: creationix: oh ya, and I think that with function Server, the function is created at parse time. if there's an assignment it won't be created until that line is executed...
[21:24] creationix: jmar777: no, nothing is created at parse time
[21:24] creationix: actually, that's not 100% true
[21:24] creationix: function hoisting is slightly different from var hoisting
[21:24] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: you would in that case
[21:24] jmar777: creationix: wouldn't this work: foo(); function foo() {}; but this fail: foo(); var foo = function() {};
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: but not in say obj.foo = function foo(){}

[21:26] adrian_berg: what's going on here? http://pastie.org/private/ptlqohajxorn7cxplyw9sq
[21:26] creationix: jmar777: but you are right, in that edge case the var version will fail because of how function hoisting is different from var hoisting
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: if you do var Server = function(){}; it wont have "Server" but if you do exports.Server = function(){}; and call it with the receiver it will show "Server"
