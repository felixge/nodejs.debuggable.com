[00:00] mraleph: ryah_: ah. I just noticed that Anton did some nice tricks when he recently fixed External::Wrap... now on x64 it can wrap pointers from 0..32G without overhead.
[00:00] mraleph: sweet
[00:00] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:00] micheil: mraleph: 32G as in 32GB's?
[00:01] mraleph: yep
[00:01] micheil: neat
[00:01] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[00:01] pyrotechnick1 has joined the channel
[00:02] mraleph: not any pointer though... it should be 8 bytes aligned... which is usually true. I guess malloc even returns 16 bytes aligned memory
[00:02] djanowski has joined the channel
[00:02] ryah_: mraleph: i actually did this because i had a lot of Weak links around
[00:02] ryah_: not so much because of the overhead of External (although, I optimized that too)
[00:03] ryah_: and we've observed allocation of these ObjectWraps (Weak + External) to be slow
[00:03] mraleph: btw. if you accidentally create weak handle for Smi --- you are toast
[00:03] mraleph: this weakhandle will never die
[00:04] mraleph: I just understood that recently
[00:04] ryah_: okay - im pretty sure i never do that
[00:04] stagas: is the process.stdout readable?
[00:04] ryah_: stagas: no
[00:04] ryah_: stagas: process.stdin is
[00:05] mraleph: well. External::Wrap can return a SMI if you put that into Handle --- booom
[00:05] mraleph: rather not boom, but leak
[00:05] arpegius has joined the channel
[00:06] ryah_: we dont weak ref the external itself
[00:06] ryah_: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/b8879d64dd4280915e47f17142e38ce9bb220bde/src/node_object_wrap.h
[00:06] ryah_: actually use Set/GetPointerFromInternalField
[00:06] ryah_: no Externals
[00:06] bingomanatee: ryah_: have noogle's digestion of the IRC chat in the can - should have a UI / POC by end of week
[00:06] mraleph: ah. then no problem
[00:07] mraleph: weakhandles are pain for GC
[00:07] stagas: ryah_: would be handy to be able to read stdout from within the process though :)
[00:08] ryah_: mraleph: i've heard that -  i guess that's where i thought the win would be
[00:08] ryah_: dealloc manually instead of on the weak-ref callback
[00:09] creationix: bingomanatee: where is the meetup on Thursday?
[00:09] creationix: up in SF?
[00:10] bingomanatee: Well I was going to try and see who was coming and where they were based - are any other attendees there? If the median place is San Mateo where I work I'll just hold it there. Otherwise I'll suggest 21st amendment. 
[00:10] bingomanatee: I'll throw a poll up on the site and see what people like. 
[00:11] bingomanatee: Can you make it?
[00:11] creationix: bingomanatee: possibly

[03:16] guybrush: Eduardo_: mv line 10 to line 8
[03:16] chrisdickinson: Eduardo_: your method will probably have to take a callback function
[03:16] bingomanatee_: aslmost. 
[03:17] Eduardo_: how do I do it?
[03:17] bingomanatee_: chris is right. 
[03:17] bingomanatee_: You need a callback function like on_get_id(id) and call it with the id from inside the anonymous function

[03:25] ph^ has joined the channel
[03:30] chrisdickinson: Eduardo_: the one thing to take away is that whenever you rely on a thing that takes a callback, to get a value back from it you need to figure out how to design your api to take a callback as well
[03:30] chrisdickinson: EventEmitters are one (particularly nice way) of doing that
[03:31] chrisdickinson: the simple way is just to take a callback function as an argument, and call it inside one of those inner functions when your result is ready

[03:32] chrisdickinson: (hopefully that makes sense, I tend to make a mess of explaining things sometimes :)

[03:51] creationix: mikeal: I made a fake http.createClient function that uses curl under the hood, do you have some request + couch code I could use to test it?
[03:51] creationix: something that would help benchmark it
[03:51] mikeal: i don't have perf code, no
[03:51] mikeal: request has as tests directory
[03:51] mikeal: most of them talk to CouchDB :)
[03:51] piscisaureus: ryah_: please merge. can you ping me as you read this? otherwise I have to write an email...
[03:52] creationix: ok, I guess I'll just try node's built-in http client tests
[03:52] creationix: jashkenas: have you tried backbone with webos (or any mobile app) yet?
[03:53] piscisaureus: ACTION goodnight everyone. it is too late already.
[03:53] jashkenas: creationix: I haven't, personally. My phone is from 1999.
[03:54] creationix: jashkenas: it's more reliable that way
[03:55] Lorentz: I'd use my old phone, only if its battery didn't die.
[03:55] Lorentz: But it did, siiigh.

[04:34] bingomanatee_: thanks.
[04:34] bingomanatee_: Oddly enough nobody that ever hires me reads my blog. 
[04:34] bingomanatee_: this town is fucked up. 
[04:34] fairwinds: hehe
[04:34] balaa has joined the channel
[04:35] bingomanatee_: Actually manateebay.com is my main blog - thats my professional blog. 
[04:36] fairwinds: yeah, just looking for more insight on authentication and authorization. I quite like express.
[04:36] bingomanatee_: At this point I think that just driving a site off facebook auth is good enough. 
[04:36] fairwinds: trying to build on the mvc example
[04:36] bingomanatee_: me too. 
[04:37] bingomanatee_: If you ever want to get your head together about a more robust MVC pattern in Node I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[04:38] bingomanatee_: One piece of advice I would posit is that the drupal model of multiple roles, each with permissions, is the best way to manage authorization.
[04:38] skm has joined the channel
[04:38] bingomanatee_: A lot of systems use single roles - one role per user - and that really paints you into a corner IMHO.
[04:41] fairwinds: I can integrate the authentication with connect-auth with regular routes like app.get('/', function(req, res) but having a bit more of an adventure with an integration in the mvc mapper
[04:41] tmzt: it would be awesome to have an mvc that can be actually understood without getting the the way
[04:42] tmzt: and the ability to map collections to orms as well as code/callbacks
[04:42] fairwinds: bingomanatee_: I am going to use an acl approach and will be using two middleware pieces
[04:42] tmzt: with the same syntax for describing routes
[04:42] richcollins has joined the channel
[04:42] bingomanatee_: I'm really motivated to get some of the good things of systems like drupal, joomla and sugarCRM without the fuckedness. 
[04:43] tmzt: without being too dictatorial
[04:43] tmzt: just a framework that I can opt into
[04:43] bingomanatee_: I spent years trying to get a Zend Framework based analog of Drupal going but nobody wanted a piece of that project. 
[04:43] tmzt: following unix philosophy
[04:43] tmzt: bingomanatee_: have you seen magento?
[04:43] bingomanatee_: heard about it - haven't seen it
[04:44] Lorentz: People aren't really into zf to do what drupal does, no.
[04:44] Lorentz: They're really in it for things drupal doesn't offer.
[04:44] tmzt: thats what it is, a presentations system based on Zend and xml files with an ecommerce focus
[04:44] perezd has joined the channel
[04:44] bingomanatee_: sounds cool. 
[04:45] tmzt: its probably the best free cart out there
[04:45] Lorentz: Heard magento was a little too deviated from zf to really be called it.
[04:45] tmzt: and very customizable
[04:45] bingomanatee_: A lot of PHP people hate ZF - I actually kind of like it, but its tough to find PHP people who like its approach. 
[04:45] tmzt: yeah its the object model
[04:45] Lorentz: bingomanatee_: Most php people just want to get something done, is probably why.
[04:45] tmzt: hah I just dont like php very much
[04:45] Lorentz: They don't want to sit around and be lectured on why zf doesn't have a "model" class.
[04:46] Lorentz: For instance.
[04:46] bingomanatee_: Thats fine - but frankly I've seen too many PHP people paint themselves into a corner. 
[04:46] shaver: yeah
[04:46] tmzt: its a template language
[04:46] tmzt: trying to be oop
[04:46] bingomanatee_: Fuckit. Doctrine or whatever works fine with ZF. 
[04:46] shaver: mostly my experience is that PHP is cornerpaint plus footgun
[04:46] bingomanatee_: I mean I took the Zupal ORM I wrote for Mongo and it works fine with ZF. 
[04:46] tmzt: magento tries to be all model though
[04:47] tmzt: havent looked at zf itself
[04:47] creationix: ACTION is listening to himself on herding code and is amazed how much has changed since that recording
[04:47] pkrumins: creationix: awesome interview
[04:47] tmzt: so, node framework
[04:47] pkrumins: i am halfway thru
[04:47] bingomanatee_: creationix - whats your url again?
[04:47] tmzt: using modules and exports
[04:47] pkrumins: bingomanatee_: http://herdingcode.com/?p=299
[04:47] bingomanatee_: Node really does a lot of things right. 
[04:47] fairwinds: the first to authenticate user/ set session. the second will just do a lookup in a list to determine a yes or no answer to allow. ie. an access control list will just hold a list of items like ['Allow','editor',['view','add']]
[04:47] tmzt: but more introspection than seems to be the norm
[04:48] creationix: lol "I mean... It's hard to run ruby code in the browser"
[04:48] fairwinds: the access control list is consulted for a route
[04:48] bingomanatee_: I'd much rather authhor a framework in Node than in PHP. 
[04:48] tmzt: why not just a checkauth call back and an acl implementation that can be plugged in
[04:49] tmzt: or even make it possible to do it in the directory structure, authed vs unauthed
[04:49] tmzt: though if your really building a cms you need a more complete cms system
[04:49] tmzt: anybody solve cross-orm user and password management nicely?
[04:50] bingomanatee_: what I would really like to do is to work on a system of interchangable design by contract so that if you want you could template in PHP, model in Python, and control in Node .. or whatever. 
[04:50] shaver: using something like thrift?
[04:50] tmzt: rabbitmq/zeromq based?
[04:50] shaver: oh, you mean in the same page flow
[04:50] bingomanatee_: sure
[04:50] tmzt: why template in php?
[04:50] bingomanatee_: just as an example. 
[04:51] tmzt: model in python might be good
[04:51] bingomanatee_: I'm saying a strong communication protocal should be cross platform friendly
[04:51] tmzt: or a python like syntax
[04:51] tmzt: jade for data
[04:51] tmzt: Ive always wanted to do css for data
[04:51] tmzt: mostly I want a framework that lets be as lazy as I want to be
[04:52] bingomanatee_: for instance if you create a good schema model in JSON or YAML you should be able to render elements of it in a view through adaptive coupling or REST without caring about the nature of the system that satisfies the repository. 
[04:53] bingomanatee_: I would like to think that a robust sytem should allow you to transport your system from MySQL to Couch or MongoDB when the nature of the data makes one system more optimal for your environment without having to premute the rest of the system. 
[04:53] skm has joined the channel
[04:54] Floxxx: i'm looking for a way to copy a file on the filesystem synchronously, is there anything that can do this?
[04:54] bingomanatee_: if you read sync and write sync doesn't that basically do the same thing? just erase when you are done. 
[04:55] bingomanatee_: However I would suggest that you consider abstracting file location to a database. 
[04:56] Floxxx: well, thing is, i have to copy multiple files and "wait" until it's done before continuing
[04:56] bingomanatee_: If you keep the file where it lays and create a repo that allows you to change the key of the record that stores the files location wouldn't that basically be the same as moving the file on the hard drive?
[04:56] Floxxx: (can't use renameSync because it might be different partitions)
[04:57] Floxxx: hmm
[04:57] bingomanatee_: I suspect if you consider the way you are managing files you can figure out how to get the app to work without physically moving files, and it will work faster and be less error prone.
[04:58] bingomanatee_: There is no reason you have to mimic your organizational system of files with a physical file heirarchy. 
[04:58] jimt has joined the channel
[04:58] piscisaureus: ryah_: there's a small fix coming, could be squashed with one of the other patches if you want
[04:58] Floxxx: it's a file upload, so filenames of the originals aren't unique
[04:59] bingomanatee_: oh - so the task is just re-filing the users' initial upload?
[04:59] Floxxx: yeh
[04:59] Floxxx: hmm, i guess i can use rename after all
[04:59] Floxxx: just upload the files to the same partition it ends up
[04:59] Floxxx: then do renameSync
[04:59] fairwinds: tmzt: my idea is to implement as middleware to attach to route ie. app.del('/user/:id', requireAuth, authorize(.. acl goes here..), function(req, res) {
[04:59] bingomanatee_: there you go. 
[04:59] Floxxx: thanks for the thoughts :)

[05:04] Prometheus: oh, you are talking about a keyboard?
[05:04] pyrotechnick: yes
[05:04] pyrotechnick: i already have lachesis's

[05:05] pyrotechnick: OMFG u can get the purple keys!
[05:06] pyrotechnick: that's so cool
[05:06] Prometheus: pyrotechnick: http://www.daskeyboard.com/
[05:06] Prometheus: the way to go
[05:06] pyrotechnick: but im not german
[05:06] Prometheus: so?
[05:06] Lorentz: Possibly Happy Hacking keyboards, but I don't like the way they lack ctrl keys.
[05:06] Prometheus: does it look german to you in the pics?
[05:06] tmzt: like get('::object/:id', object, function(req, res),
[05:06] Lorentz: And honestly, I never really liked cherry switches.
[05:07] Lorentz: (which DAS keyboards use, brown ones iirc)
[05:07] Lorentz: Or did they use blue, you might be able to pick and choose.
[05:07] Prometheus: an optimus keyboard would drive me nuts tho
[05:07] Prometheus: the displays on the keys flicker like crazy
[05:08] Prometheus: at least, in the previews
[05:08] Prometheus: but it could be just the camera :)
[05:08] Lorentz: Don't get blue cherry switches, they're loud as hell.
[05:08] Lorentz: I got my wife this: http://www.auspcmarket.com.au/info/KE-FKB104MC-EP/1838/
[05:09] Prometheus: pink?
[05:09] Lorentz: Blue switches was a bad idea, but it's the only decent pink keyboard in the world.
[05:09] Prometheus: good God :o
[05:09] mscdex: node.js rules!
[05:09] Lorentz: Filco keyboards are nice though.
[05:09] fairwinds: tmzt: app.get('/products/:id', function(req, res) is typical kind of route for a collection
[05:10] amerine has joined the channel
[05:10] Lorentz: http://www.auspcmarket.com.au/info/KE-FKBN87M-EB/1838/ <-- a nice tenkeyless, brown switches
[05:11] tmzt: sure but then you have to write all the functions
[05:11] Prometheus: Lorentz: seem tad expensive too, but I guess you get what you pay for
[05:11] bingomanatee_: \me finally got his TOS Enterprise the right shade of metallic grey
[05:11] bingomanatee_: ACTION dammit
[05:11] Lorentz: Prometheus: That's why I just got myself a Model M instead.
[05:11] Lorentz: Cheaper.
[05:11] tmzt: I mean get with and withoutids, all the sub fields you want map urls to etc
[05:11] Prometheus: well, I have a BT apple keyboard right now
[05:11] Prometheus: and I'm quite happy with it
[05:11] Prometheus: since I like the "laptop" feel
[05:11] tmzt: the last function would be optional and it would expose something on object instead
[05:11] derferman has joined the channel
[05:11] piscisaureus: you psychos
[05:12] bingomanatee_: ACTION likes his Logitech keyboard.
[05:12] piscisaureus: makes me think of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoIvd3zzu4Y
[05:12] Lorentz: I can never go back to using rubbery keyboards, unless it's decent scissor switches, like my thinkpad keyboard.
[05:13] tmzt: or something like list(req, res) .entry(req, res) with params for things like id handled automatically
[05:13] Lorentz: HE EVEN HAS A WATERMARK
[05:13] Lorentz: Yes, it's like that with keyboards.
[05:14] briznad has joined the channel
[05:14] tmzt: and the route would map ::object to the object paramter but everything under it would also be mapped through the passed in object if a route existed for it
[05:14] tmzt: so ::object/ would be object.list()
[05:14] tmzt: ::object/id would be object.get(req.params.id, res)
[05:15] piscisaureus: something wrong, lorentz? you're sweating
[05:15] tmzt: if it returned an object instead of sending res.end() or whatever to the stream it would be treated recusrizvely
[05:16] tmzt: or ::object/::things/:id would be object.things.get(req.params.id, res)
[05:16] tmzt: then you can handle post to a collection, put and del on an :id
[05:16] tmzt: and even fields
[05:16] tmzt: and its all explicit
[05:17] creationix: brianc: I'm back
[05:17] tmzt: so on this you could have orm plugins that follow the same conventions and even handle pre and post callbacks with db access handled inbetween
[05:19] tmzt: if you preferred you could treat the subpaths the same way you do server
[05:19] tmzt: with things = new Path()
[05:19] bingomanatee_: By the way if anyone can figure out how to use node with mongoLabs - for some reason I used the christkov/native system and got shot down on auth. 
[05:19] tmzt: things.list(), things,get(), etc.
[05:20] bingomanatee_: maybe someone from the mongoose crew might want to work with them... ?
[05:20] tmzt: and pass the resulting things to .get('::things/...',things,null) routes

[05:39] jdonley83: *it stopped
[05:40] pkrumins: well what do you think the error message tells you?
[05:40] brianc: if you followed the instructions exactly from the wiki and you're having build problems you might want to try building the 0.2.x branch
[05:40] jdonley83: i'm building the 0.2.5 branch
[05:41] brianc: or you might not have installed the correct dependencies in cygwin (the process for installing these is outlined in the wiki)
[05:41] jdonley83: should i go earlier
[05:41] developNdeployON: hmm.
[05:41] jdonley83: i picked all the packages listed in the wiki
[05:41] theSamePLATFORM: sounds tough.

[05:41] fairwinds: bingomanatee_, tmtz: right, should have said objects there. I have only ever used s3 but for some file storage. I use couch for most part
[05:42] bingomanatee_: ACTION would like to pick up couch some day.
[05:42] fairwinds: bingomanatee_: quite easy and can use as a file store also
[05:43] bingomanatee_: well maybe I'll use it for Noogle just to change gears a little. 
[05:44] bingomanatee_: does couch do text searches well?
[05:45] ewdafa has joined the channel
[05:45] bingomanatee_: I've been leaning on MongoDB a little hard lately. 
[05:47] fairwinds: bingomanatee_: you can plug into lucene easily
[05:47] bingomanatee_: Thats plan b - have used solr. 
[05:47] pkrumins: for searching?
[05:47] fairwinds: well couch-lucene works in an integrated way so you are using same api
[05:47] pkrumins: i use sphinx
[05:48] bingomanatee_: yeah - I'm indexing this channel for searching. 
[05:48] bingomanatee_: sweet. 
[05:48] fairwinds: bingomanatee_: am using elasticsearch but it has its own api
[05:49] bingomanatee_: sounds cool. 
[05:49] fairwinds: since I am generally using couch as a db with its api
[05:51] bingomanatee_: elasticsearch looks cool. I think I could get into using that at work. 
[05:52] RockShox1 has left the channel
[05:52] fairwinds: sure, and you can just add more nodes
[05:52] bingomanatee_: in your experience how does elasticsearch compare to lucene/solr?
[05:54] creationix has left the channel
[05:54] fairwinds: elasticsearch is fast, easier to work with, json and there is a 'river' that listens to couch for changes to index docs
[05:54] bingomanatee_: im getting hot for it already
[05:54] jimt_ has joined the channel
[05:55] echosystm has joined the channel
[05:55] fairwinds: solr is great but does not really fit the stack I am working with
[05:55] blaines has joined the channel
[05:57] fairwinds: bingomanatee_: mongo doesn't have a changes feed like couch as far as I know
[05:57] bingomanatee_: Yeah but my data don't change.
[05:57] fairwinds: heh
[05:57] bingomanatee_: I'm using it as a log cache. 
[05:58] bingomanatee_: I do change a few flags when I find stuff of interest but for the most part that happens beofore the first write 
[05:59] bingomanatee_: Kind of obliterates the use of the in-memory features of MongoDB too..
[05:59] fairwinds: k, well anytime you write to couch there is a feed and you can subscribe to and it  will push  
[06:00] fairwinds: so you can do some pretty cool things with it. 
[06:00] bingomanatee_: That actually souhnds interesting. 
[06:00] ron_frown has joined the channel
[06:01] fairwinds: for example set up an upload server, listen for changes from couch to work on some files, or send real time notifications etc.
[06:02] ron_frown: so i have a node server that runs on port blah... and want to ensure that when my web app fires up, its the most likely to stay connected
[06:02] ron_frown: do people usually set something up that is a heartbeat or something
[06:02] bingomanatee_: connected to what?
[06:02] ron_frown: I am running node.js with socket.io server on port 8018
[06:02] bingomanatee_: oh you mean up?
[06:03] ron_frown: and socket.io clientside stuff
[06:03] bingomanatee_: this is an idiot "brute force" attempt but you can have cron launch your app and if the old app is up it will just crash. That being said there are better launch daemons out there. 
[06:03] ron_frown: not exactly what I meant
[06:04] ron_frown: currently i have it just connect
[06:04] ron_frown: and dont do anything until something happens server side
[06:04] ron_frown: but seems like its real hit and miss
[06:04] ron_frown: dont get errors
[06:04] ron_frown: connections dont get made
[06:05] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:05] ron_frown: so first I'd like to wrap in some error handling, so if I get a request with problems, it doesnt grenade
[06:05] bingomanatee_: thats all I got ... anyone else have any ideas?
[06:05] JimBastard has joined the channel
[06:05] ron_frown: I guess it'd make sense to run it on a port thats more likely to be open on a firewall
[06:08] fairwinds: is it an issue of staying up or staying connected

[08:39] hunterloftis: eags_: I guess my point is, it doesn't look like blog has been maintained
[08:39] bingomanatee_: must find new cave!
[08:39] eags_: the session thing is a recent api change for connect
[08:39] hunterloftis: eags_: You could possibly pull the source to "wheat"
[08:40] eags_: But even after that it still breaks with the form stuff I was mentioning
[08:40] eags_: hunterloftis: what is wheat?
[08:40] hunterloftis: https://github.com/creationix/wheat
[08:41] hunterloftis: That's just a node blogging engine (if that's what you're interested in)
[08:41] eags_: hunterloftis: oh, I'm not, I'm just trying to learn node/express and was stumbling on that one example
[08:42] hunterloftis: eags_: Yeah skip that example, go with some of the others ;)
[08:42] eags_:  DoNaLd`: So it is running but every time I try and type anything in the console I get a dialog "Server Error Error no handler for hook 'command'"
[08:43] eags_: hunterloftis: yeah, although it is sort of key functionality for parsing forms, that was why I was wondering if it was broken in some versions and not others or if it was breaking because of a version mismatch somewhere with some dependency.
[08:43] jbpros has joined the channel
[08:43] hunterloftis: For parsing forms? You'll want to use connect-form on top of node-formidable

[13:09] pyrotechnick: and when i press w i want every other client to get that event too
[13:09] SubStack: I've considered writing a separate module to do this
[13:10] flippyhead has joined the channel
[13:10] pyrotechnick: but it would be nicer if it wernt doing it with events but rather just by syncing the position objects of players
[13:10] pyrotechnick: so it's like there's no network code at all
[13:10] pyrotechnick: dnode kinda just spies on your player
[13:10] pyrotechnick: and tells all the others what it's doing
[13:10] pyrotechnick: make sense?
[13:10] SubStack: yep
[13:10] pyrotechnick: okay ill take a stab at it tonight
[13:10] pyrotechnick: i know you can do it faster cleaner and better

[13:11] broofa has joined the channel
[13:11] SubStack: nobody's asked for it but it's come up and I've thought about it
[13:12] SubStack: oh actually one person wondered why I had attributes at all if they weren't synchronized
[13:12] pyrotechnick: yeah
[13:12] pyrotechnick: it would be nicer as an external package
[13:12] pyrotechnick: i dont think it's something that belongs in dnode itself
[13:12] SubStack: agree
[13:12] SubStack: useful as it is
[13:12] pyrotechnick: it will give people the wrong impression of dnode
[13:13] SubStack: already a problem!
[13:13] pyrotechnick: and it's too application-specific i think
[13:13] pyrotechnick: loving dnode though dude
[13:13] pyrotechnick: it'll be perfect after these syncs are done
[13:13] pyrotechnick: very very perfect
[13:13] pyrotechnick: we're making a little 2d minecrafty clone for facebook
[13:14] pyrotechnick: mmoish

[13:14] pyrotechnick: will push when it's playable
[13:14] pyrotechnick: harmony proxies are implementable with getter/setters?
[13:15] pyrotechnick: like it there some kind of reference implementation

[14:30] yorick: Aikar: doesn't using require() in the template block the entire node
[14:30] Aikar: thats only done on compile
[14:30] yorick: how does it decide when to recompile?
[14:31] Aikar: on compile it executes the function, then builds up all the html thats static, and has functions for the dynamic 'onRender' parts
[14:31] Aikar: and then on render it goes through the compiled list, executes the functions and inserts the answer in place of the function
[14:31] Aikar: so once the entire source list has no functions (ie no more onrenders), it outputs
[14:32] yorick: what if the answer is asynchronous
[14:32] Aikar: thats why its a callback to render
[14:32] Aikar: nova.onRender(function(renderVars, render) { db.find().first(res) { render(res.title); }); })});
[14:32] Aikar: it waits until all of the functions have responded back

[14:44] stalled has joined the channel
[14:45] Aikar: but to help explain some of my nova stuff, look here, https://github.com/Aikar/node-nova/blob/master/tests/partials/partial.js
[14:45] Aikar: on compile that caches to ['<span class="onRenderPartial">\n", [Function],'</span>'
[14:46] Aikar: then when function is ran with arg 3, its replaced to ['<span class="onRenderPartial">\n", 3,'</span>']
[14:46] Aikar: then thats "reparsed" to build it down to 1 whole string
[14:47] Aikar: the function could respond with nova syntax like {b:3} instead of plain '3'
[14:47] jherdman_ has joined the channel
[14:47] pgte has joined the channel
[14:47] Aikar: and it would of been ['<span...>', {b:3}, '</span>] which would of then been reparsed into '<span ...><b>3</b></span>' then outputted

[14:54] Metal3d: ./configure and/or make don't take care on LIBDIR env var... any suggestion ?
[14:56] Aikar: Metal3d: node installs to /usr/local/lib which is due to ./configure --prefix is /usr/local
[14:56] Metal3d: I set --prefix to /usr
[14:57] Metal3d: it is ok for everything excepting lib
[14:57] Aikar: Metal3d: also node doesnt install any real libraries into /lib, only javascript code for MOST part (npm modules may compile)
[14:57] Metal3d: :) 3 days I try
[14:57] Aikar: it should still work being in /usr/lib if you prefix=/usr
[14:58] Lorentz: The issue is it's not correct for x86_64 systems, isn't it
[14:58] Aikar: i run a 64bit system, works fine with default settings (although im redhat)
[14:58] Metal3d: yes, but I cant do this because rpm packages have some standards to follow

[15:00] Metal3d: For now, I only move libs to correct path... but I wonder if there isn't another way to do to be cleaner

[15:02] Metal3d: there is 2 others fixes to check, wafadmin tools are python scripts... sometimes they have shebangs, sometimes not... and are not executables... any reason ?
[15:02] matt_c has joined the channel
[15:04] Metal3d: Lorentz, sorry, yes
[15:04] Metal3d: for x64 I must install libs to usr/lib64 directory, not into /usr/lib

[15:09] remysharp has joined the channel
[15:09] Metal3d: I'll test, but for wafadmin files, I don't know what to do with
[15:12] remysharp: hey - does the http response object automatically close? in that I've sent a header, then res.write(xyx) - but trying to keep the connection open, and it seems to close when I curl it from the command line

[15:13] bingomanatee_: in the expresss.js examples no extra actions are taken after response.render.

[15:16] Aikar: caolanm: i ended up going with eval :/ plus the vm stuff didnt seem to like the scripts running node commands
[15:16] Metal3d: Aikar, ok, I correct wscript and it works as expected
[15:16] Aikar: and i wanted my script to be able to require()
[15:17] Aikar: Metal3d: does the package manager stop you just because of a file path?
[15:17] Aikar: there has to be a way to force it to ignore it...
[15:17] hij1nx has joined the channel
[15:17] Metal3d: in fact it's not the problem
[15:17] Metal3d: you have 2 rpm you can install
[15:18] Metal3d: x64 and i386
[15:18] Aikar: or just do ./configure --prefix=/usr/lib64/local/ and let it be /usr/lib64/local/lib lol
[15:18] Metal3d: I you want to install both, and both packages installs lib at the same place... you will have troubles
[15:19] Metal3d: Aikar, we must not touch /usr/local with "standard packages"
[15:19] shinmei has joined the channel
[15:19] Aikar: so only make 1 package, i dont think node has any special x64 stuff anyways does it?
[15:19] Metal3d: v8
[15:19] v8bot: Metal3d: undefined
[15:19] Metal3d: the V8 engine is 64bit compiled
[15:19] Aikar: are you publishing this for others to use or just your own self?
[15:20] Metal3d: Aikar, I will put it into Fedora repositories
[15:20] ttpva: hi. is there a way to ping a server and read the response in node.js ?
[15:20] Aikar: ah
[15:20] Metal3d: :)
[15:20] Metal3d: that's why is very strict
[15:20] Metal3d: we must be clean
[15:20] Aikar: well the user really shouldnt be installing both lol
[15:21] Metal3d: I can patch files in rpm spec, that's what I do now... I only have to undestand why wafadmin scripts are installed into lib dir :)
[15:21] Aikar: and even if they did, it still wont hurt anything
[15:21] Aikar: the lib folder just holds javascript
[15:21] Aikar: there is no 32bit/64bit  versions of that
[15:21] Metal3d: Aikar, sometimes workers must test i686 to give the work to clients... that's why :)
[15:21] Metal3d: Aikar, there is v8 libs too
[15:21] Metal3d: the engine
[15:22] Aikar: thats statically compiled into node i believe
[15:22] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[15:22] Metal3d: ho right !
[15:22] Aikar: i dont remember seeing any v8 stuff in my libs folder
[15:22] Metal3d: god, I can do 2 packages so :)
[15:22] Metal3d: it's nice !
[15:22] Metal3d: I have solution so !
[15:23] Metal3d: Aikar, the standard allows me to do node.js-libs package that depends on node.js
[15:23] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[15:23] Metal3d: node.js-libs can be "noarch"
[15:23] Metal3d: it's cool, thanks :)
[15:24] Metal3d: but, wafadmin...
[15:24] Metal3d: I don't know what is it
[15:25] Aikar: Metal3d: thats a python build script used to compile modules for node

[15:47] Lorentz: There was even one that used zf
[15:47] Aikar: have an entire IPC framework for PHP to multiple processes for it, so each module is a process so it cant block the TCP connection
[15:48] Lorentz: Nice

[15:48] jakehow has joined the channel
[15:48] Aikar: my current IPC framework for PHP is really damn good, got an event loop in it so you can write non blocking IO in PHP and i got a game server i ran on it, but node is such a better language for it

[16:22] pyrotechnick: legacy :(
[16:22] pyrotechnick: github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules
[16:22] yorick: booths: you could use sockets
[16:22] bingomanatee_: I take it you already did a git hub search for node mssql?
[16:22] yorick: and figure out the protocol
[16:22] colinclark has joined the channel
[16:22] squeeky: the lack of pragmatism in modern day programmers seems to be declining some days.
[16:23] booths: bingomanatee_: yeah everything is mysql
[16:23] pyrotechnick: booths: you may be able to find some kind of gateway for mssql
[16:23] bingomanatee_: You might be better off creating a PHP web service at the database end. 
[16:23] pyrotechnick: yeah
[16:23] bingomanatee_: Or ruby or something. 
[16:23] pyrotechnick: something like that
[16:23] booths: I have access to a Windows server as well
[16:23] pyrotechnick: u cud use like
[16:24] bingomanatee_: .NET for that matter is prbably the easiest solution. 
[16:24] pyrotechnick: mssql <-> ruby <-> dnode
[16:24] booths: I might end up hacking together a middleman type page like you're suggesting. I'm not 100% familiar w/ the socket approach yorik recommended
[16:24] pyrotechnick: if u use ruby
[16:24] pyrotechnick: and dnode
[16:24] pyrotechnick: then you wont have to do any protocol or messaging shit
[16:24] bingomanatee_: I would suggest that .NET since your client is a MS platform, would produce a really fast and easy web service. 
[16:24] yorick: you could just do the protocol
[16:24] pyrotechnick: i dont think mssql would be a nice protocol to target

[16:25] yorick: microsoft documented it

[16:27] bingomanatee_: "Okay - what is Facebook's "brand"? I mean - really - is "We have no style or class so we're just going to redefine middle of the road while we focus on keeping our servers up" a brand? Or Google's "Brand"? They could run their whole site without a single CSS file if they wanted to.  Ebay could too.. I think Craig's list has CSS now but if they tossed it nobody would notice.

[16:48] herbySk: bradleymeck: and the naming seems inconsistent, somehing is capitals, something lower, ..., it seemed to me as "a pile of various code in one place", reminding me of the felling I had when I saw ruby docs... I think time slowly comes when it will be too musch to coordinate and pieces doing same things will be scattered at many places...

[16:48] bingomanatee_: pass by reference you mean? have you RECL'd that test?
[16:49] Kingdutch: Well, you could do pass by ref I suppose
[16:49] Kingdutch: But I really meant pointers
[16:49] Kingdutch: Although they work in a similair fashion
[16:49] Kingdutch: And I have not RECL'd that
[16:49] bingomanatee_: The distinction between references and pointers is lost on me. 
[16:49] Kingdutch: Also I don't know what RECL is
[16:49] bingomanatee_: type node without any parameters. 
[16:49] bingomanatee_: hit return
[16:49] bingomanatee_: you are put into an interactive shell
[16:50] eikke: isnt it called REPL?
[16:50] Kingdutch: bingomanatee: a Reference is two variables that share values and if one changes, so does the other
[16:50] bingomanatee_: not anymore. 
[16:50] Kingdutch: A pointer is a variable holding a memory address
[16:50] herbySk: Kingdutch: no pointers
[16:50] Kingdutch: So you need to tell it you want to change the value the mem address points to, and not the mem address
[16:50] gartenstuhl has joined the channel
[16:50] pyrotechnick: if you want pointers use node-ffi
[16:50] Kingdutch: Oh is that RECL?
[16:51] bingomanatee_: but if another variable is pointing to that memory address, doesn't its value change too?
[16:51] herbySk: Kingdutch: only passing by reference, which only works on typeof "object" or "function"
[16:51] Kingdutch: herbySk: Ah ok
[16:51] Kingdutch: bingomanatee_ http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~patrick/csc418/wi2004/notes/PointersVsRef.pdf
[16:51] bingomanatee_: Yeah pass string by value, obj/function by reference. 
[16:52] bradleymeck: herbysk im sure ryah would lay down the law if you want to make naming definitive, i think he is following the unix api pretty closely
[16:52] pyrotechnick: until he became friends with windows
[16:53] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at Windows
[16:53] Kingdutch: Hmmm
[16:53] herbySk: kingdutch: nevertheless, you example will not work for any type, since args of functions are variables on their own (whether holding reference or value)
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: hmm, so the http client totally barfs on HEAD requests
[16:53] Kingdutch: herbySk: So there's no way to make a func change an external variable?
[16:53] dbarker has joined the channel
[16:53] bingomanatee_: Hey... don't hurt Windows. Its the best gaming platform there is. 
[16:53] bingomanatee_: Its just not appropriate for real work. 
[16:53] bradleymeck: kingdutch nope
[16:53] Kingdutch: Gah
[16:54] bradleymeck: you can do f'ed up stuff with type coersion though, http://www.wikihost.org/w/nodejs/type_coersion
[16:54] Kingdutch: Graphics Engines are so much easier with pointers
[16:54] mscdex: i thought DOS was the best gaming platform
[16:54] bingomanatee_: Windows = DOS + Video Card
[16:54] bradleymeck: kingdutch, but pointers present issues for attacks and covert side-effects

[16:55] statim has joined the channel
[16:55] isaacs has joined the channel
[16:55] herbySk: kingdutch: yes and no. other point of view you can see at it (not untrue one) is that everything already are pointers, passed by value (and you can only have pointer to an object, never pointer to a pointer itself). If you pass insied anything via which the function can change the external value, it will...
[16:55] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: i dont know many parts of games that are actually better unmanged
[16:55] statim has left the channel
[16:55] Kingdutch: Being able to store a vertex buffer somewhere, and just edit it somewhere else is easy
[16:55] Kingdutch: It means the gfx engine can just render the vertex buffer
[16:55] Kingdutch: An I can change it without any problems
[16:56] Kingdutch: Otherwise I have to retrieve, create a whole new buffer, and put it back in
[16:56] herbySk: so either you pass the function which will set the value, or you pass the parent object which actually contains the variable you want to change
[16:56] Kingdutch: That means there's gonna be spikes of memory*2
[16:56] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: you can modify a buffer...
[16:56] pyrotechnick: set it to something other than static
[16:56] binarypie has joined the channel
[16:56] bradleymeck: kingdutch, if i have a pointer and it gets passed around it can change from an area and you have to account for that change in every place it is visible, the fact that you must check prior to any use of a pointer for valid data is a concern in many ways, im not sure how you can think it isnt unless you dont check your data
[16:56] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: I'm not talking about the buffer in the GFX cared
[16:56] Kingdutch: card8
[16:56] Kingdutch: I'm talking about the buffer in JS
[16:57] Kingdutch: You need an array with points to do LOD and stuff with, that you pass to the memcard
[16:57] pyrotechnick: ohhhh
[16:57] hunterloftis has joined the channel
[16:57] Kingdutch: bradleymeck: I don't see that as a covert side effect though
[16:57] bradleymeck: you could also make a preallocated buffer and just hold onto it and manage its memory patterns yourself (basically giving you a pointer system)
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: ryah_: ping
[16:57] Kingdutch: I see it as a known thing, and thus you can account for it
[16:57] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: generally you dont use "buffers"
[16:57] Kingdutch: a simple if(!pointer) { die('This thing aint supposed to be 0 here :O'); } is simple enuf
[16:57] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[16:58] pyrotechnick: you use the typed javascript arrays and then set the draw mode to something other than static and then bufferSubData

[17:00] herbySk: kingdutch: do not hold thing in variable, but instead inside objects or arrays, then you can always indirectly change the value of a property or cell
[17:00] herbySk: \no other way in js
[17:00] Kingdutch: How is an array not a variable?
[17:00] herbySk: an array cell is not
[17:00] Kingdutch: var arr = []; is just like var str = 'string';
[17:01] Kingdutch: Right
[17:01] Kingdutch: But how can I indirectly change an array cell
[17:01] Kingdutch: If I can not indirectly chagne a string
[17:01] Kingdutch: That resides in the same scope
[17:01] herbySk: var arr=['string'] lets you pass arr and modifiy its [0]
[17:01] bradleymeck: var b=[{x:1}]; b[0].x //1, b[0]={x:2}; b[0].x //2
[17:01] bradleymeck: you dont need indirection

[17:03] Kingdutch: herbySk: Aaah ok, because the example I said earlier didn't do that
[17:03] pyrotechnick: without their geer on
[17:03] tjholowaychuk: Imperion: I believe expires is derived from maxAge right now, so the store is relatively in sync. regardless req.session should pretty much always be defined
[17:03] bingomanatee_: ZING!
[17:04] pyrotechnick: you two
[17:04] pyrotechnick: you two need to go and take a cold shower
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: whether it is a new session or not is a different thing
[17:04] pyrotechnick: SEPERATELY
[17:04] bradleymeck: Kingdutch, any Object is passed by reference any other is passed by value and is effectively a singleton
[17:04] bingomanatee_: right as always
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: Imperion: I had started a branch refactoring the session middleware but it will be a bit, not much time
[17:04] pyrotechnick: did SubStack go sleepies

[17:04] pyrotechnick: SubStack: marco
[17:05] herbySk: kingdutch: if you come from C world, look at everything in js a pointer: every variable hold a pointer its actual value (never the value itself), and when fucntion is called, pointer are passed by value.
[17:05] herbySk: that way you get insight in how it works
[17:06] pyrotechnick: man JS is JITed
[17:07] Evet: do you know a good nodejs hosting?
[17:07] Kingdutch: herbySk: Ok that works, then I can just keep my *buffers in a central place and edit them outside

[17:10] dbarker: hi all - working on a simple server to write raw uploaded data to a file, noticed that my code depends on a race condition. If it takes a while to set up the 'data' event handler of an http server request, is there a way to guarantee that no data events will be missed? Suppose I could all request.pause() until handler is set up, but not sure what's right.... sample code here: https://gist.github.com/786445
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: what did you expect lol its not magic

[17:12] hobodave has joined the channel
[17:12] tjholowaychuk: but, no one really wants to save the session manually all the time

[17:14] syskk: or should I simply clone the git repo and install the build the appropriate tag
[17:14] isaacs: syskk: i keep a git repo and pull from ry/master every so often.  then i use nave to see other versions.
[17:14] tjholowaychuk: syskk: https://github.com/visionmedia/n

[17:24] perezd has joined the channel
[17:24] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: That makes sense. One of the reasons I'm looking at rails is because we've built Express up a lot; but I think building up introduces fewer hacks than breaking down.

[17:43] Imperion: tjholowaychuk: now.. it suddenly works
[17:43] tanepiper: although tbh I ended up writing a Proxy/Store for Dnode instead, and just use connect for static content + upload handling and it works much nicer than their pretty pathetic attempt at JSONRPC

[17:44] tanepiper: but they only provide examples for PHP and Ruby
[17:44] hdon has joined the channel
[17:45] tanepiper: and it's a bitch to implement, this was much easier to do as i basically copied the ExtDirect proxy + store and implemented DNode callbacks and it just works

[18:04] Kingdutch: Line counts can be very high without them actually contributing anything
[18:04] isaacs: since most people *don't* talk that much, it's actually pretty valid.  not noiseless, of course.

[18:05] isaacs: Kingdutch: if they comein here, we make fun of them.
[18:05] isaacs: and tell them to use gist or pastie.
[18:05] isaacs: ;)
[18:05] tmzt: bingomanatee: one of my goals is to have a nodejs setup where you can pull in the right git submodules and have a nice framework to start with, though I still fully intend to both code and control everything that happens, just don't like writing *boilerplate* code anymore
[18:05] tanepiper: tmzt: not neccasarily, you just need a good definition file that keeps up with nodejs modules
[18:05] tanepiper: so i can do fs.<tab> and get all the methods available on fs
[18:06] Kingdutch: isaacs: I'm not even talking  about pasting code lol
[18:06] isaacs: Kingdutch: actually, i'm probably one of the worst \n abusers in here.
[18:06] mraleph: piscisaureus: I am running tests on MinGW compiled bleeding_edge HEAD... will take some time cause I can't run them in parallel due to some bug in Python on Windows
[18:06] tanepiper: i suppose it would need something to check the requires though, incase i do var filesystem = require('fs')
[18:06] isaacs: have to be, to keep up with JimBastard 
[18:06] Kingdutch: isaacs: Article says otherwise, but yeh, those 3 lines, I see :')
[18:07] tanepiper: If anything, I would love to see PyDev/PyCharm but for nodejs, and javscript in general
[18:08] tanepiper: but for that to get traction, you probably need nodejs compilable under windows, or cygwin support baked in
[18:08] mraleph: piscisaureus: it will approximately take an hour 
[18:08] stagas: tmzt: I recently started working a project like that, http://github.com/stagas/express-helpful

[18:10] piscisaureu_ has joined the channel
[18:10] tanepiper: mraleph: what's the alternative other than to get nodejs compiling nativly under windows
[18:10] stagas: tmzt: though it's a mess now, but I'm using some common patterns from my experience with express, sort of extending it
[18:10] mraleph: make it compile with Visual Studio (best case) or mingw (worst case)
[18:11] fairwinds: JimBastard:  nodejitsu looks pretty good
[18:12] tanepiper: mraleph: best case, you can then write nodejs code in Visual Studio :D
[18:13] tmzt: tanepiper: yeah I know, but having it on a server would be neat for rapid prototyping, which is how I meant it

[19:19] JimBastard: i think netsplit stagas 
[19:19] mattie: error
[19:19] Kingdutch: stagas: It might have lost you in the netsplit
[19:19] JimBastard: mattie: so increase your FD count, but more importantly you prob have a programming error
[19:19] JimBastard: and you arent closing FDs
[19:20] mattie: JimBastard: the limit is already 999999
[19:20] JimBastard: unclosed files, un-ended http requests, etc
[19:20] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[19:20] JimBastard: mattie: so you have a programming error, why you need 99999 fds open at once
[19:20] Kingdutch: JimBastard: This error actually happens if you throw a 1000 requests at the default node http server
[19:20] Kingdutch: (Atleast on my box)
[19:20] stagas: don't notice netsplits with the conference mode

[20:02] statim_: anyone know how to gracefully exit a node app? im currently using express and redis, so i thought expressserver.close() and redisclient.quit() would do the trick, but something must still be hanging around (if nothing is in the main event loop, the app should exit, right?)

[20:32] hunterloftis: I'm worried about the stability of the project we're building in node. Lots of libraries throw errors even in async methods, which has the potential (if uncaught) to take down the whole server. Even if you catch uncaught errors on process, you still lose your stack...
[20:33] JimBastard: hunterloftis: bad libraries
[20:33] hunterloftis: JimBastard: The one I'm using now is yours ;)
[20:33] tmzt: making a node instance less stateful would make it possible just to restart it instantly

[20:36] mawkor2: haha
[20:37] bingomanateeIpho: Check the logs. Lots of ugly.
[20:37] Kingdutch: Yeh
[20:38] mawkor2: it works great on OSX and ubuntu... I got it to build on cygwin fine and I can console.log etc but net and http package are being weird
[20:38] Kingdutch: IMO we should drop Cygwin support and tell people to get virtual box
[20:38] Kingdutch: I've seen perfectly good code fail on cygwin
[20:38] mawkor2: I have vbox
[20:38] mawkor2: and ubuntu on vbox
[20:38] Kingdutch: Then use ubuntu on virtualbox
[20:38] Kingdutch: Don't use cygwin when you have vbox with ubuntu
[20:38] Kingdutch: o.O
[20:38] mawkor2: but I'm running on a windows env :(
[20:38] Kingdutch: That s like shooting yourself in the foot with a shotgun
[20:38] Aikar: so
[20:38] Aikar: mount your windows drive into your vbox
[20:38] bingomanateeIpho: So stop.
[20:38] Kingdutch: You got a vbox with ubuntu
[20:38] mawkor2: it's a windows corporate network : \

[20:39] mawkor2: stagas Im running the test script but it just exits out 
[20:39] Kingdutch: Networks don't care about linux/windows <- mawkor2 
[20:39] SubStack: microsoft should dedicate a murder of minions to fix the node/windows problems

[20:40] bradleymeck: i wont disagree with using cygwin, i will just say cygwin had plenty of bugs
[20:40] mawkor2: haha
[20:40] bradleymeck: not even w/ node on it
[20:40] Aikar: if its for work, simply tell them "windows isnt compatible
[20:40] mawkor2: cygwin on windows > wine on linux 
[20:41] stagas: opening up a cygwin shell takes a second, how long does firing up a virtual box with ubuntu take?
[20:41] pagameba: tjholowaychuk: how do you get the message on the client, is there a lib for that or just get the cookie?

[20:41] tjholowaychuk: pagameba: req.flash() will give you an object with all of them, req.flash(type) will give you an array of messages for thhat type
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: (if any)
[20:42] bingomanateeIpho: And unity and flash rock.
[20:42] bradleymeck: does anyone know how to test if a <link> element is loaded without polling to see if it has a .sheet property?
[20:42] stagas: I prefer convenience over compatiblity, but if I deploy I do it on centos
[20:42] bingomanateeIpho: Its just a ss clusterf@@k
[20:43] Aikar: mawkor2: simply tell your manager you did research and found windows is not really suitable for deploying a node.js application and you recommend they either a) get you a company approved VM setup on your PC with an environment to match production, or b) get you access to a linux dev box that matches production
[20:43] Aikar: i run windows at work, but i mount the dev server as a network drive and edit everything on there
[20:44] mawkor2: I've done a) and b)
[20:44] mnbvasd: Aikar: harsh.
[20:44] pagameba: tjholowaychuk: ok, its a convenience to store information in the session - I get it now :)
[20:44] mawkor2: I want to create a multiplatform environment for various reasons
[20:44] Aikar: if its for work, why make your life 10x harder?
[20:44] mawkor2: because I am a socialist
[20:44] Aikar: lol..
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: pagameba: specifically messages that are meant to display once
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: pagameba: for example req.flash('info
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: fuck
[20:44] hunterloftis: Anybody know how to CLI a multline string into the node interpreter?
[20:45] pagameba: lol
[20:45] mawkor2: it's not really that hard...
[20:45] Aikar: so am i, but being a masochist doesnt really compliment being socialist
[20:45] SubStack: day 1 dig a hole, day 2 fill it in!
[20:45] SubStack: windows programming feels like that
[20:45] mawkor2: well yeah
[20:45] mawkor2: .NET is ok
[20:45] Aikar: putting your self through pain when you dont need to is silly
[20:45] tjholowaychuk: req.flash('info', 'login successful'); then you could redirect to '/' or something, and it will span across that redirect and  display
[20:45] mawkor2: it's less of a pain than java
[20:45] mnbvasd: mawkor2: true
[20:45] Aikar: trying to run an app through cygwin? i dunno
[20:46] bradleymeck: hunterloftis, does '\' at end of line not work for you?
[20:46] hunterloftis: bradleymeck: Weirdly no, already tried that
[20:46] bradleymeck: odd
[20:46] mnbvasd: Aikar: running cygwin on wine is just plain painful, how am I meant to test that? ;)
[20:46] Aikar: wait what
[20:47] mnbvasd: Aikar: I thought you were a masochist? ;)
[20:47] Aikar: no, i said i was socialist :p
[20:47] mnbvasd: damn hippy ;P
[20:47] stagas: mape: people really like your map :) I've been seeing comments all day talking about the graphics
[20:47] mape: stagas: At work? :)
[20:48] Aikar: he said 'because im a socialist' is why hes wanting to go through the pain of trying to run it under windows (ie masochism)
[20:48] Aikar: so i replied with that
[20:48] mnbvasd: Aikar: strange.
[20:48] stagas: mape: I hackernewsed it it's been on the frontpage for some hours

[22:05] booths: Connect the module, what are you getting app.get from?
[22:05] masahiroh has joined the channel
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: Eduardo: app.get('/user/:id', ...)
[22:06] stagas: booths: connect.router(function(app) {})
[22:06] booths: stagas: Right, I asked if he was using connect and he acted like he didn't know what it was.
[22:06] booths: stagas: so I asked where he was getting the app.get from
[22:07] pagameba: tjholowaychuk: I just confirmed that I am an idiot :)  req.url does not contain the protocol, hostname and port ever (I think it did in a previous version of node though)
[22:07] stagas: Eduardo: what kind of social network are you building?
[22:07] Eduardo: uhm.. I will look the code

[22:33] saschagehlich: JimBastard: node-mailer always waits for a server response
[22:34] ryah_: piscisaureus: but can you get that data from just read() on stdin?
[22:34] JimBastard: saschagehlich: worst library name ever
[22:34] ryah_: piscisaureus: it seems like you're creating buffers from the keypresses
[22:34] JimBastard: seriously
[22:34] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[22:35] saschagehlich: JimBastard: what, node-mailer?
[22:35] JimBastard: rename that to coffee-mailer or something
[22:35] piscisaureus: ryah_: though read() on the console doesn't really work -- it always blocks, you can't do select on it, and read fails if you're requesting to read more than a few kb. plus it doesn't give you arrow keys and the such
[22:35] pdcawley has joined the channel
[22:35] JimBastard: saschagehlich: yeah
[22:35] piscisaureus: ryah_: yeah. if you would use read it would yield use exactly the same data buffers as you get now
[22:35] ryah_: piscisaureus: but it can be done in a different thread
[22:35] ryah_: what about node script.js < file
[22:35] ryah_: windows has pipes, right?
[22:36] ryah_: redirection, imean
[22:36] piscisaureus: ryah_: that's not a console. it will use fs.stream in that case
[22:36] ryah_: i see
[22:36] saschagehlich: JimBastard: whell actually this is more or less a private repo
[22:36] piscisaureus: because tty.isatty(0) == false in that case
[22:36] saschagehlich: no watchers, no forks, no readme.md ;)
[22:37] ryah_: piscisaureus: what about "echo 'blah' | node script.js"
[22:37] piscisaureus: same
[22:37] ryah_: does it also use fs.readstream?
[22:37] piscisaureus: yeah
[22:37] ryah_: ok
[22:37] JimBastard: saschagehlich: lol, a private repo is a private repo. all im saying is that you shouldn't take a library name and then make a library that does similar functionality and only change the name by replacing the "_" with a "-". its confusing for people
[22:37] JimBastard: i checked out your project and it looked pretty nice too
[22:37] ryah_: piscisaureus: so is your repl working now?
[22:38] piscisaureus: ryah_: completely. but I'm testing the v8 upgrade you did now
[22:38] saschagehlich: JimBastard: well it's a mailer for node, why shall I call it coffee-mailer ;) 
[22:38] piscisaureus: ryah_: the only thing is util.inspect coloring
[22:38] ryah_: piscisaureus: right. which i'll do :)
[22:38] piscisaureus: ryah_: are you happy now or do you still have an uncomfortable feeling?
[22:39] saschagehlich: I'm always coding javascript stuff with coffeescript but I always provide js files (compiled coffee)
[22:39] ryah_: piscisaureus: well it's okay
[22:40] ryah_: i'm not totally happy that a simple script like "process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout);" needs to load all the TTY stuff
[22:40] ryah_: process.stdin.resume(); process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout);
[22:40] JimBastard: fine, ill just rename node_mailer to mr_mailer
[22:41] JimBastard: or shemail, yeah that will work
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[22:41] mnbvasd: lol ;)
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: shemail
[22:41] ryah_: piscisaureus: i feel that the escape char interpretation should be done in readline...
[22:41] mnbvasd: is anyone working on the tls modules?
[22:41] ryah_: piscisaureus: or some where out of the way
[22:41] ryah_: piscisaureus: i guess on windows it comes natively
[22:42] piscisaureus: ryah_: that's the problem. I feel that it makes not sense to transform you keypresses TO excape chars first and then try to decode it
[22:43] ryah_: piscisaureus: i agree
[22:43] ryah_: this is a reasonable compromise no
[22:43] ryah_: now
[22:43] piscisaureus: ryah_: but remember that tty.ReadStream only gets loaded when stdin is a tty AND the program is accessing
[22:43] ryah_: piscisaureus: does the test-repl.js pass for you?
[22:43] piscisaureus: it
[22:43] saschagehlich: lol^^
[22:44] ryah_: piscisaureus: maybe you should setup a buildbot for mingw?
[22:44] piscisaureus: ryah_: I can't really think of any occasion where you would want to read from the tty and not be interested in keypresses :-)
[22:45] piscisaureus: ryah_: could do. but where. I don't have a vps at my disposal
[22:45] ryah_: piscisaureus: process.stdin.resume(); process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout);
[22:45] ryah_: piscisaureus: from your home box?
[22:45] piscisaureus: ryah_: print everything you type. Use case?
[22:45] bmavity has joined the channel

[22:45] piscisaureus: cat from tty?

[22:46] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: cat > /tmp/test
[22:47] ryah_: piscisaureus: i mean if you wanted to write cat in node
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: I find it handy sometimes, no that I would be writing it in node lol but I see the use-case
[22:48] mnbvasd: I've created a simple patch for tls, which enables you to do "starttls" type functionality on an already existing tcp connection...
[22:48] mnbvasd: https://gist.github.com/787053
[22:48] piscisaureus: ryah_: yeah. get back at me when someone complains about `node cat.js > out.js` memory usage
[22:48] mnbvasd: is it too evil to submit? or is it likely to be accepted?

[22:59] echosystm: ok
[22:59] echosystm: now say i want two stateless http servers
[22:59] piscisaureus: konobi: to do this kind of stuff we need to get rid of libev and use a different model to juggle sockets and the such
[22:59] echosystm: what's the best way to load balance and failover between them, without a single pojnt of fail?
[23:00] echosystm: i dont want to use one of those hardware load balancers, because there's a single point of failure again
[23:01] konobi: piscisaureus: oh.. PeekNamedPipe()
[23:01] piscisaureus: konobi. yeah. where?
[23:01] piscisaureus: busyloop?
[23:02] piscisaureus: konobi: I'm sure it can be done with a lot of trickery now
[23:02] piscisaureus: konobi: but I'm not doing it anytime soon
[23:03] bradleymeck: echosystm at some point there will be a single point of failure no matter what you do, but have a nameserver list IP addresses to 2 machines that are replicated with the primary first?
[23:03] echosystm: ok now
[23:03] echosystm: if one of those servers goes down
[23:03] echosystm: the nameserver will still be pushing out the dead IP
[23:04] echosystm: will web browsers automagically move to the next IP or what?
[23:04] echosystm: (i'm not too familiar with DNS)
[23:04] bradleymeck: basically
[23:05] echosystm: ok, that's good
[23:06] konobi: bradleymeck: round-robin generally isn't sufficient for failover... load balancing yes

[23:39] postwait: ryah_: in fairness you can't reasonable trust a CA signed cert without a recent CA signed CRL saying its not invalid.
[23:39] postwait: so.. not useless.. just *really* dangerous.
[23:40] pquerna: +/- ocsp
[23:40] postwait: OCSP would be nice, but you can make due...
[23:40] nejucomo: You can't reasonably trust a CA signed CRL without a more recent CRL saying it's not invalid.
[23:41] postwait: you can trust the CRL.. just not that it's recent.
[23:41] pquerna: well, thats why ocsp is a good thing (tm)
[23:41] pquerna: but if you have internal CAs
[23:41] postwait: it is a good thing
[23:41] pquerna: distribution of the CRLs can be.. automated etc
[23:41] postwait: but having a 300 day old signed cert... leave a lot of assumptions about the safety of the corresponding key
[23:41] nejucomo: I'm being facetious, but I'm skeptical about the value of either CRLs or OCSP compared to cert expiration/renewal.
[23:42] statim_: anyone know how to see what is still happening on the main event loop? i believe ive closed everything, but node isnt exiting, so something must still be active.  any way to find out?

[23:43] mischievious has joined the channel
[23:44] nejucomo: If ca's are broken all the time, then why won't ocsp/crls be broken likewise?
[23:44] nejucomo: It's duct tape over the underlying problem.
[23:44] mischievious has joined the channel
[23:45] nejucomo: For example, it's easier to spoof an unsigned ocsp error response than it is to forge a cert.  How do clients proceed if they get an error from the ocsp service?
