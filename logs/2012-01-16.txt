[03:36] Aria: (like saslauthd, which is purpose-built for this, or  against an imapd, or a RADIUS daemon)
[03:36] Aria: The separate daemon approach fits in well with node.

[03:52] devaholic has joined the channel
[03:52] teadict: of course... php is just a preprocessor
[03:53] panosru: yes
[03:53] teadict: you can replace php with anything, technically

[03:53] panosru: I mean.. if you need to use gd lib for example or other stuff
[03:53] maletor has joined the channel
[03:54] teadict: if you need to do stuff with something that's not supported by node yet, you can always call a script that does it for you in another language
[03:54] panosru: teadict: yeap that's the point, use each tool for it's best purpose :)
[03:54] teadict: from node
[03:54] Vennril2 has joined the channel
[03:54] teadict: yeah
[03:55] panosru: I replaced already php on web services, for instance I use Axis2 for web-services since php is not strong enough on this part but now that I'm doing R&D on node I'm wondering how it can compete axis2 on restful web-services

[03:57] teadict: php CAN'T be strong on anything distributed or concurrent

[04:02] clutchski has joined the channel
[04:02] panosru: :D
[04:02] panosru: yeah I saw them
[04:02] panosru: but in any case currently axis2 works fine with SOAP/REST for me
[04:02] panosru: what I will do is I will create same rest API on axis2 for a project I have and for node.js
[04:03] sh1mmer: It's a performance question, often
[04:03] panosru: and I will use node.js as main to see it's performance and if something goes wrong I will fall back to axis2 which is tested
[04:03] sh1mmer: seems like a reasonable approach
[04:04] panosru: it will increase the development time but if you do R&D it happens quite a lot :P

[06:42] xeodox: even on the small it takes 15 min though - node.js is freaking huge
[06:43] cmr: It's all of node, and all of v8
[06:43] deoxxa: wut
[06:43] deoxxa: node.js compiles pretty fast
[06:43] deoxxa: considering what it contains
[06:44] deoxxa: try compiling mongodb - then come back and say node.js is huge
[06:44] xeodox: i downloaded the binary of mongodb :D
[06:44] cmr: I use a source-based distro, so I experience the compile times of everything :)
[06:44] deoxxa: is it gentoo
[06:44] cmr: 15 minutes isn't much
[06:44] deoxxa: (lol)
[06:44] cmr: deoxxa: no
[06:44] cmr: exherbo
[06:45] xeodox: fail! It doesn't work i just copied it over -.- haha
[06:45] cmr: xeodox: I think you can use debootstrap to help with the cross compile process, or they might even have one in the repos.
[06:46] RobertWHurst: Hello everyone. Can any of you help me out. I'm trying to bind to a url on an existing server the same way socket.io does to send its client side script. The problem is that when I try to bind my own event handler to the request event The handler of the original server tries to write to the header a second time.
[06:48] chrisdickinson: RobertWHurst: socket.io unbinds the original `request` event listener from the server and saves it.
[06:48] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:49] chrisdickinson: (so basically, the server only has one listener -- your app -- and if your app doesn't decide to respond to the request, it can manually call the original listener)
[06:49] RobertWHurst: Oh... I get it now, Thanks very much chrisdickinson.
[06:49] chrisdickinson: no prob!
[06:50] chrisdickinson: RobertWHurst: I think it's happening here, for reference: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/master/lib/manager.js#L110

[11:06] cmr: Which one?
[11:06] ger^kallisti has joined the channel
[11:07] deoxxa: template inherhitence and order of preference
[11:07] cmr: And what engine?
[11:07] jldbasa has left the channel
[11:08] deoxxa: the way that i've done the context object makes it really hard to do
[11:08] deoxxa: https://github.com/deoxxa/node-ginger
[11:08] joshwines has joined the channel
[11:08] deoxxa: i think i need to re-think the context object, actually
[11:08] cmr: Ah
[11:08] deoxxa: say you have an index page, inheriting a layout
[11:09] robertstuttaford has left the channel
[11:09] deoxxa: in the layout you include a header and a footer
[11:09] deoxxa: the layout defines space for a block, "content"
[11:09] deoxxa: in the index page, you define content for that block
[11:09] cmr: Right
[11:09] cmr: (Similar to jinja2, no?)
[11:09] deoxxa: but then you define content in the header and the footer too
[11:09] deoxxa: yep, it's meant to work the same way
[11:09] deoxxa: which "block" should be rendered?
[11:10] deoxxa: and then - if you use parent(), what should parent() be in the header? how about the footer? etc.
[11:10] deoxxa: basically i was thinking the template chain would be a simple line, but it's more of a tree

[11:13] maritz: is it possible that redisClient.get() (mranney/node-redis) doesn't work properly due to ES5 object.get()? because for some reason when i do .get() i don't receive the key, but if i do mget (with one key) it works. tried debugging into it but for some reason that doesn't work properly in this case.

[11:20] cmr: deoxxa: it has to be a tree, as soon as you have includes and blocks.
[11:20] deoxxa: yeah, but i thought i could get away with just storing the parent node
[11:20] deoxxa: and not the children
[11:21] deoxxa: like, i thought i would only ever need to traverse up the tree
[11:21] cmr: deoxxa: Why must one programmatically declare their templates anyway?
[11:21] deoxxa: how do you mean?

[11:22] deoxxa: heh
[11:22] deoxxa: i implmented an on_not_found thing in the context object
[11:22] cmr: So it does lazy loading?
[11:22] deoxxa: so you can load a template from disk, from a remote location, etc
[11:22] deoxxa: yeah
[11:23] cmr: Nice
[11:23] cmr: That was going to be my other recommendation :)
[11:23] deoxxa: in the browser, that might mean fetching the (compiled or not) template from a server

[12:12] zomg: I use vim for node stuffs, but we use PhpStorm (which is kinda like WebStorm except with PHP features) at work
[12:12] zomg: Although I use the IdeaVim vim emulator in PhpStorm too =)
[12:13] chjj has joined the channel
[12:14] cmr: I tried using the vim plugin for visual studio and it just didn't cut it.
[12:14] zomg: Yeah some of the plugins are kinda poor
[12:14] zomg: IdeaVim is ok, but it's kinda buggy at times
[12:14] cmr: I pretty much wanted vim embedded in there, with all the background compilation and stuff.
[12:15] zomg: Still, it's tolerable enough to warrant using it over the standard editor
[12:15] cmr: yeah
[12:15] zomg: That's pretty much how Ideavim works.. You get all the standard editor's features but with vim keybindings
[12:15] cmr: Pretty much the only thing the plugin i tried was movement and simple yank/put.
[12:15] zomg: I just wish it had a few other features and worked a bit more reliably
[12:15] cmr: No registers, no marks, etc.
[12:16] zomg: IdeaVim has registers and marks, most movement things I've tried etc.
[12:16] cmr: Nice
[12:16] zomg: Main things I'm missing is text objects, like di" to delete things inside quotes
[12:18] Industrial: I'm using SublimeText2, which has a nice vim plugin
[12:18] Industrial: which is unfinished but usable
[12:18] Industrial: IDEAVim is really buggy for me
[12:18] zomg: Yeah it is kinda :/
[12:19] Industrial: There is also PIDA, but it seems abandoned (and was never really picked up by a lot of people)
[12:19] duffman has joined the channel
[12:19] Industrial: I, personally, think a rewrite of the functionality is much better then shoehorning vim into an IDE
[12:20] bLUEEE: also, whats the correct way to install node without installing a lot of other thigns like homebrew etc.. i'd like node, express and npm
[12:21] hackband_ has joined the channel

[12:24] cmr: Industrial: Ah, so eclipse would implement all of vim, visual studio would implement all of vim, etc?
[12:24] bLUEEE: just one other thing, ideally I wanted to install node/express on windows but i read that theres a fair few problems, moreso with express - is it working out for most people if anyone is on windows ?
[12:25] Industrial: bLUEEE: right so. First produce something with node, then worry about things like this.
[12:29] zomg: bLUEEE: it seems node things generally work kinda poorly on windows.. a lot of people have trouble compiling modules etc. (eg. they don't compile on win at all or it's difficult)

[12:36] stefpb has joined the channel
[12:37] jbpros has joined the channel
[12:38] zomg: ilon__: if you installed less with -g (eg. globally) you would also need to install it local to your application *without* -g
[12:38] RLa has joined the channel
[12:42] ilon__: zomg: uh, i dont get the logic behind that, and yes, i am indeed trying to install it globally.
[12:42] zomg: That's how the default require paths work or something like that
[12:42] torvalamo: you can link it instead of reinstalling it locally
[12:43] torvalamo: npm link x
[12:43] ilon__: thats just wrong. :(
[12:43] ilon__: <- new to node
[12:44] torvalamo: the thing is, you can have multiple directories with node apps.. if you install the packages globally and link them, it will only have one instance of each package instead of a thousand different versions
[12:44] ilon__: yeah
[12:44] ilon__: i just wish i didnt have to include that with my app.
[12:45] aslant has joined the channel
[12:45] torvalamo: people using node are used to installing required packages
[12:45] torvalamo: so dont worry
[12:45] torvalamo: you'll get used to it
[12:45] torvalamo: npm will save your life
[12:46] ilon__: the dependencylist gets rather long only to include less in my app.
[12:46] torvalamo: yes but npm installs less's dependencies for you
[12:48] stefpb has joined the channel
[12:48] ilon__: all i want is a standalone compiler for less, how hard could it be :(
[12:48] jamescarr: ha! I love it when I get contacted for hire by companies that I contribute code via pull requests to their open source projects :)

[12:49] mmalecki: jamescarr: that's the way I got hired by nodejitsu!
[12:50] deoxxa: jamescarr: nice work!
[12:51] ilon__: torvalamo: i take it there are no way to install and invoke it globally without the need to install it in the local app aswell?
[12:51] jamescarr: yeah, but it's only half the way. last couple offers were wanting someone onsite
[12:51] jamescarr: for me that's hard given I have 2 houses on the market out here :S
[12:51] maritz: ilon__: i fear you'll have to write your own then... not wanting any dependencies is a rather pointless endeavor unless you want to write a lot of code just for fun :D
[12:51] jamescarr: so I'm hoping this offer allows for remote
[12:52] torvalamo: ilon__, no there isn't, unless you add /usr/local/lib/node_modules to node's require lookup

[12:53] ilon__: torvalamo: that was my first thought
[12:53] torvalamo: ilon__, it used to be the case in earlier versions that it was all global
[12:53] ilon__: torvalamo: just thought there might be an option for it, i cant be the first person thinking about it.
[12:53] davetayls has joined the channel
[12:53] torvalamo: so they've moved away from it
[12:53] torvalamo: not "not thought about it"
[12:53] ilon__: torvalamo: bummer.
[12:54] maritz: ilon__: sudo npm install less -g && lessc --version
[12:54] maritz: works fine for me
[12:54] ilon__: maritz: try to do lessc /some/file.less
[12:54] torvalamo: there's the thing with sudo/root too.. you're supposed to be able to install it locally without having root access, which used to be required before
[12:55] maritz: torvalamo: for local installs you don't need sudo if you have write access in the current folder, yes.
[12:55] ilon__: torvalamo: yes, but i do want it installed globally, and be usable without installing it locally aswell.
[12:55] torvalamo: that's what i'm saying, maritz
[12:55] torvalamo: npm used to be global
[12:55] torvalamo: by default
[12:55] indutny_ has joined the channel
[12:55] torvalamo: and require sudo
[12:55] torvalamo: not anymore
[12:55] garrensmith has joined the channel
[12:56] torvalamo: ilon__, you don't have to install it locally
[12:56] torvalamo: just link it
[12:56] maritz: ilon__: i just tried it with the example from lesscss.org, works fine.
[12:56] ilon__: torvalamo: i still have to add the files to my cvs that way, didnt want that :P
[12:57] torvalamo: you use cvs?
[12:57] Glenjamin: just ignore the node_modules folder
[12:57] maritz: ilon__: you don't need the local install. global works fine
[12:57] ilon__: Glenjamin: then the other developers would have errors.
[12:57] maritz: and as Glenjamin said you should ignore node_modules anyway
[12:57] maritz: ilon__: add it as a dev dependency in your package.json and let other devs do "npm install . --dev"
[12:58] Glenjamin: the other devs can just npm install
[12:58] ilon__: `lessc -v` works, but as soon as i try to call it with a filename it fails.
[12:58] maritz: in what way?
[12:59] ilon__: maritz: http://pastie.org/3194718
[12:59] eb4890 has joined the channel

[13:00] deoxxa: > i still have to add the files to my cvs

[13:01] ilon__: it SEEMS its my actual .less file causing the problem.
[13:01] ilon__: > i still try to be polite on internet
[13:01] ilon__: wow.
[13:01] Glenjamin: anyway, if you want dependencies bundled, then adding them to version control is the correct approach
[13:02] Glenjamin: the global npm directory isn't on the path for require by default
[13:02] ilon__: maritz: you'r absolutely correct, seems it DOES work just doing npm install -g, seems to be my less that breaks the parser, which dosnt throw a correct error.
[13:02] maritz: devDependencies are better imho
[13:03] maritz: ilon__: on the other hand: i can't require it either. plus i don't see it in npm ls -g and can't uninstall it. something is weird here. :D

[15:11] deoxxa: i'm going to be using it at work for email templates and config files too
[15:11] cmr: yawNO: I pretty much write what I'm going to end up with while I'm prototyping anyway, so I like things like jinja and weld and plates.
[15:11] yawNO: deoxxa: i see
[15:12] yawNO: cmr: my idea is.. the faster i code, the more i have fun
[15:12] yawNO: that's why i stick w/ coffeescript && jade

[15:19] Aikar: yeah its not unheard of, it can be made to (hell pullreq accepted if you want to do it :P), just i havent had time to do it
[15:19] Aikar: I want to change a few things first though
[15:19] Aikar: ie switch the callbacks to match node style of fn(err, res)
[15:19] yawNO: sry deoxxa but i like non html :P
[15:20] deoxxa: sounds more like you like only html
[15:20] Aikar: so it can then be used with like streamline

[15:21] wssr has joined the channel

[15:21] Glenjamin: powerpoint / keynote are fine
[15:21] yawNO: push some new code and then i'll see what i can do for nova
[15:21] Aikar: with streamline
[15:21] Glenjamin: good slides contain either 1 large picture, or 1 large sentence
[15:21] Aikar: lol Glenjamin 
[15:21] yawNO: if i can of course :(

[15:22] fantastikibne: sorry not 2 request per second , 2 requests in 7 second
[15:22] yawNO: Glenjamin: gotta benchmark stuff
[15:22] jtsnow has joined the channel
[15:22] cmr: fantastikibne: because you don't indent your code, so it rebels

[15:23] deoxxa: fantastikibne: can you perhaps make that harder to read?
[15:23] rauchg has joined the channel
[15:23] cmr: fantastikibne: why are you using eval?
[15:23] fantastikibne: cmr: for read settings

[15:25] Aikar: I write it too technical :P
[15:25] yawNO: Aikar: i'm italian

[15:25] jaequery has joined the channel
[15:25] Aikar: well, more specifically I suck at grammar
[15:25] yawNO: don't worry :P .. i'll manage to understand it somehow
[15:26] Aikar: I wish someone whos smart enough to read it to understand it, can then rewrite it in a more easier to understand way
[15:27] fantastikibne: 100 request in 19 seconds :/ still very slow
[15:27] yawNO: uhm
[15:27] yawNO: fantastikibne: made me wonder
[15:27] Aikar: the basic point of it is theres a specific JS object style that nova interprets, of {tagname: [{attributes}, [childrennodes]] where children nodes can be the exact same thing, and its smart to figure out what you mean when you dont use that exact format. and then there is function tags like span('Foo') that translates down into the object style, so you have cleaner code
[15:27] yawNO: how do you guys benchmark apis?
[15:28] yawNO: okay
[15:28] yawNO: Aikar: looks fairly easy to use
[15:28] sriley: httpload?

[15:29] Aikar: pretty much is, its just need to know the style to avoid gotchas. also understanding how to use dynamic data with onRender

[16:33] cmr: shanebo: That order isn't guaranteed at /all/
[16:34] tjfontaine: at least not by the posix standard
[16:34] shanebo: cmr, woah, I had no idea
[16:34] uptownben: Why would this be missing in a new node install (re-compile)? /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/utils/tar.js
[16:34] cmr: Nor should you depend on it.

[16:35] fernandezpablo85: guys, I'm running latest node from source
[16:35] fernandezpablo85: and I'm getting:
[16:35] fernandezpablo85: Trace: http.Client is a legacy interface and will be removed in the near future. Do not use it.
[16:35] fernandezpablo85: googled it but I don't see what's the alternative
[16:36] shanebo: cmr, so I need to run a sort on the array?
[16:36] fernandezpablo85: is there a list of deprecated apis?
[16:36] cmr: Doesn't look like Node implements scandir
[16:36] augustl: fernandezpablo85: http.request
[16:36] cmr: shanebo: Why do you need it to be sorted?
[16:36] augustl: fernandezpablo85: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#http.request
[16:36] shanebo: cmr i need it in alphabetical order for override purposes
[16:36] cmr: shanebo: then yes, sort it

[16:37] aslant has joined the channel
[16:37] tjfontaine: scandir just does the right thing with qsort before giving you the results, it's nothing particularly special
[16:37] fernandezpablo85: augustl: So the problem is on the http.createClient line right?
[16:37] fernandezpablo85: that's what is causing the deprecation warning
[16:37] fernandezpablo85: ?
[16:37] augustl: fernandezpablo85: you shouldn't use http.createClient :)
[16:37] augustl: it's not even documented
[16:37] fernandezpablo85: augustl: I will remove it now
[16:37] uptownben: anyone know of a quick way to completely remove node and npm so I can re-install to try to resolve this issue
[16:37] uptownben: ?
[16:37] shanebo: cmr, tjfontaine what a hassle.
[16:38] cmr: fernandezpablo85: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html

[18:18] Aikar: and JQ is JS
[18:18] torvalamo: mansoor, one thing is abstraction across projects, but abstracting something that you only need once in a project is pointless
[18:18] yawNO: jQuery is a runtime lib
[18:18] torvalamo: and the definition of bloat
[18:18] mansoor: jquery is what gave javascript a second life in the "web 2.0" phase
[18:18] yawNO: so
[18:18] markq: I ONLY use MochaScript
[18:18] perezd has joined the channel
[18:18] mansoor: torvalamo: ofcourse that would be silly
[18:18] yawNO: all the checks it has to do to preserve crossbrowser
[18:18] Aikar: jquery is pretty much the same concept of node_modules, are you against using libraries in general?
[18:18] torvalamo: i use torvalamoscript
[18:18] torvalamo: it's full of bad code
[18:18] yawNO: it slows a lot
[18:19] yawNO: plus
[18:19] mansoor: jquery slows? :O

[18:19] mansoor: if anyting its speeds you up
[18:19] Aikar: yawNO: its a required sacrifice for working in in a web industry
[18:19] mansoor: unless you are a clientside JS ninja
[18:19] markq: sometimes I have to switch over to ExpressoScript though
[18:19] mansoor: its highly optomized 
[18:19] tomyan has joined the channel
[18:19] Aikar: the only option is to just not support IE
[18:19] torvalamo: no, use libraries, that's fine.. libraries have a function.. jquery doesn't have a function other than making js look nicer and does extra shit you don't need
[18:19] yawNO: Aikar: but my point is mainly another
[18:19] mansoor: torvalamo:  :O have you done much clientside developement?
[18:19] yawNO: jQuery is a whole new language
[18:20] torvalamo: yesh
[18:20] yawNO: still
[18:20] teadict: jquery keeps winning because it has a lot of plugins that do shit automagically
[18:20] Aikar: no its not
[18:20] yawNO: it pretends to be JS
[18:20] Aikar: its javascript
[18:20] teadict: jquery's core is nothing more than underscore
[18:20] mansoor: jquery ises imderscpre
[18:20] mansoor: ?
[18:20] teadict: yawNO: it is js
[18:20] mansoor: *uses underscore
[18:20] yawNO: at least CS is known to be another lang
[18:20] yawNO: teadict: it has so many helpers
[18:20] torvalamo: i use a lot of libraries, but i tie them together myself, and tailor them to each project.. i don't type $.makeMagicPlx('some stuff that does something') and call it a day
[18:20] teadict: so?
[18:20] yawNO: that the real js you use
[18:20] dscape has joined the channel

[18:21] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[18:21] mansoor: markq, i don't even know anymore :(
[18:21] yawNO: if you learn CS, you don't learn JS either

[18:22] Kunda has joined the channel
[18:22] yawNO: but don't pretend jQuery to be JS :P
[18:22] torvalamo: all i said was the people in jquery aren't using js
[18:22] torvalamo: :p
[18:22] yawNO: agree
[18:22] yawNO: :P
[18:22] mansoor: disagree
[18:22] torvalamo: in the context of node being the main js thing
[18:22] torvalamo: or taking over the world, as it were
[18:22] robotmay has joined the channel
[18:22] yawNO: i mean... i've used jQuery a lot
[18:22] yawNO: i still use it
[18:22] markq: jQuery is syntatic sugar for JS
[18:22] markq: nothing more
[18:22] mansoor: most jquery users are nubs and designers but its still javascript, NEAR macro javascript, but javascript non-the-less
[18:22] yawNO: see SammyJS or stuff like that
[18:23] plutoniix has joined the channel
[18:23] yawNO: but i don't feel like i'm using JS w/ jQuery
[18:23] teadict: what mansoor said
[18:23] yawNO: it's more of a dialect :P
[18:23] torvalamo: technically it's js syntax, but show people non-jquery js and they won't know wtf is going on
[18:23] yawNO: exactly
[18:23] bradwright has joined the channel
[18:23] chrisdickinson: jquery hides a lot of how javascript works.
[18:23] teadict: yawNO: you're "using" it
[18:23] yawNO: teadict: yep i am
[18:23] chrisdickinson: i'm a "huge" "fan" of how it aliases $.prototype to $.prototype.fn.
[18:23] markq: and I firmly believe that if you haven't used JS BEFORE jQuery then you've set yourself up for trouble
[18:24] chrisdickinson: or, rather, $.prototype -> $.fn.
[18:24] yawNO: markq: agree
[18:24] yawNO: the last part i mean
[18:24] markq: jQuyery masks a lot of things about JS that the developer needs to know to be a successful developer
[18:24] yawNO: exactly
[18:24] eldar has joined the channel
[18:24] yawNO: if you use jQuery

[18:24] yawNO: after learning JS
[18:24] fernandezpablo85 has joined the channel
[18:24] yawNO: it's just fine
[18:25] yawNO: but learning jQuery first.. will totally take you in the wrong path
[18:25] torvalamo: i used jquery for a whole project once (yes i had the patience) and the amount of times i had to code OUTSIDE jquery's model made me want to hunt down whoever wrote it
[18:25] torvalamo: leaky abstractions
[18:25] torvalamo: it's gonna happen
[18:25] chrisdickinson: aside from the weirder parts of jQuery -- the aliasing of prototype, the fact that it packs every single utility function under the sun into the library, and the fact that it's version of the ES5 array methods don't match their signature -- it's not a bad thing to pick up.
[18:25] draginx has joined the channel
[18:25] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[18:26] chrisdickinson: and it certainly reflects the time it was made in -- there really wasn't a good way to modularize those components at the time.
[18:26] draginx: is there any reason why socket.on('connection'); works fine but socket.send() on the client-side wont send?
[18:26] markq: having said that it's completely up to the developer whether or not to code in jQuery syntatic sugar or to code in JS without any sugar. But remember guys: Too much sugar can cause diabetes :O
[18:26] yawNO: lol
[18:26] yawNO: anyway
[18:26] GrandMa has joined the channel
[18:26] torvalamo: draginx, are you receiving it properly?
[18:27] yawNO: if you have to use a lib
[18:27] chrisdickinson: just pedantry: it's not syntactic sugar. it's just library sugar :)
[18:27] yawNO: at least use sonething like
[18:27] yawNO: mootols
[18:27] yawNO: which extends JS
[18:27] torvalamo: it's syntactic syrup
[18:27] markq: agreed ^
[18:27] chrisdickinson: coffeescript -- with its language changes -- is syntactic sugar. jquery is just a library.
[18:27] willwhite has joined the channel
[18:27] draginx: torvalamo: uhh socket.on('connection') does execute when I go to the page...
[18:27] yawNO: but cs is a new language
[18:27] draginx: but socket.on('message') doesn't pick anything up
[18:27] yawNO: that is common knowledge
[18:27] draginx: when im just trying to socket.send('hello');
[18:27] yawNO: if you learn cs you can't code js
[18:28] chrisdickinson: yeah, but calling jquery syntactic sugar is strictly wrong.
[18:28] yawNO: good js i mean
[18:28] chrisdickinson: that's... not exactly true either. it's worth spending some time with CS.
[18:28] josh-k has joined the channel

[18:29] yawNO: is that you code 3x fastee

[18:29] mansoor: bogus
[18:29] isaacs: yawNO: i don't code 3x faster in CS
[18:29] yawNO: it sucks a bit when it comes to debugging
[18:29] chrisdickinson: *ymmv.
[18:29] mansoor: you just learned to type faster when you started CS :p
[18:29] yawNO: isaacs: i do 
[18:29] isaacs: i debug 3x slower in CS
[18:29] markq: CS is not a new language
[18:29] tanepiper has joined the channel
[18:29] isaacs: you spend more time debugging than writing.
[18:29] torvalamo: you're also making bulk js code through cs
[18:29] yawNO: isaacs: i said that indeed debug is an issue
[18:29] isaacs: seems like CS is optimizing the wrong problem.
[18:29] markq: CS is a syntactically pleasing offshoot

[18:30] cronopio has joined the channel
[18:30] yawNO: come on
[18:30] chrisdickinson: too much ambiguity in the language.
[18:30] yawNO: check something like

[18:30] chrisdickinson: also, too many free footguns.
[18:30] chrisdickinson: but that's just me. others may have a better time with it.

[18:31] yawNO: arr = (do item for item in array)
[18:31] tuhoojabotti: Stop playing, and start codin'.
[18:31] yawNO: and the js equivalent
[18:31] yawNO: it IS faster
[18:31] yawNO: compiled code is crap though
[18:31] yawNO: i agree with that
[18:31] teadict: depends

[19:16] markq: anyone think it's a good idea to use redis for session store and mongodb as the main database?
[19:17] markq: I was thinking about redis for storing sessiosn because it's all in memory
[19:17] mAritz1 has joined the channel
[19:17] markq: anyone currently use this setup?
[19:18] draginx: markq: I have and it works pretty wel
[19:18] yawNO: derbyjs uses it

[19:18] yawNO: and it's a damn cool project
[19:18] devaholic has joined the channel
[19:18] markq: awesome
[19:19] markq: i honestly think that's the best setup
[19:19] yawNO: redis should be pretty performant when it comes to get/set for session 
[19:19] bingomanatee: markq: despite this being a tenable strategy -- I would point out that any time you have two repos you invite race conditions, bad synch issues, and versioning conditions. 
[19:19] yawNO: plus there's an adapter for connect
[19:19] yawNO: which means that the whole thing makes sense
[19:20] yawNO: brb
[19:20] bingomanatee: so as long as you are doing things like storing IDs in session and data in Mongo you are probably fairly safe. But you should think long and hard as to what you store where. 
[19:20] markq: bingomanatee: agreed

[19:20] githogori has joined the channel

[19:21] tmcw has joined the channel
[19:21] bingomanatee: For instance, a shopping cart in Redis makse sense, buecause the data isn't "real" til they check out. (depending on your bus. model.)
[19:21] yawNO: long time no see
[19:21] langworthy has joined the channel
[19:21] markq: bingomanatee: exactly
[19:21] markq: that's what I had in mind
[19:22] markq: all the non-persistant stuff in redis (or with minimal persistance) and everything else that is "permanent" so to speak, in mongo
[19:22] markq: speeds up the chain
[19:23] bingomanatee: But you do have to look out -- for instance, if you put data in your shopping cart about a given product and its product definition changes in Mongo you can get into issues. Especially if, for instance, you can keep shopping carts active in Redis for days on end. (People leave browsers open for a LONG time and page ajax can keep sessions alive all the while.)

[19:25] gseguin has joined the channel
[19:25] yawNO: okay i'm not
[19:25] bingomanatee: Mainly, only store keys in Redis -- perhaps in the cart case, keys and quantity -- not metadata. And validate all data taken out of Redis with Mongo. 
[19:25] bingomanatee: Lastly, if anyone ever wants to do the grunt work, I would be curious to see exactly how much faster Redis is than Mongo - given that its not storing formatted data I'm sure it is a bit faster -- but it would be interesting to set up a test scenario, in one case storing session AND app data in Mongo against session in Redis AND data in Mongo.

[21:05] monk12: hello all, I'm reading the nodebeginner.org tutorial. and they get to the part where they show how the sleep() function they made on a webpage is blocking operation... then they move onto a exec('ls -al') example to show how to show the directory listing in a callback to solve the blocking issue... i was curious if you can fix the sleep so it also gets fixed? or can't issue a callback to a javascript function you made yourself (just things node uses 
[21:05] monk12: like exec() which allow callbacks to be attached to them?)
[21:06] hz has joined the channel
[21:06] stride: monk12: uh, link? :)
[21:06] monk12: I guess you can move the javascript sleep() operation to a shell command to simulate that 2nd example. but still curious if you can fix it within js...
[21:06] monk12: k...
[21:07] monk12: http://www.nodebeginner.org/  and look for: sleep(10000)
[21:07] stride: ah
[21:07] neilk_ has joined the channel
[21:09] monk12: so /start is a blocking operation. if someone else went to /upload , would have to wait 10s... but they don't mention how to solve this super simple/(impractical) sleep() example and move onto another harder 'exec' problem (which coincidentally has an easy solution).

[21:09] Wizek has joined the channel
[21:10] monk12: Is it just a good example to show the problem... but not solvable in node?
[21:11] stride: that's pretty much a non-issue imho since you wouldn't really wait/poll inside the node event loop in a real world app
[21:11] mark_azevedo has joined the channel
[21:11] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[21:11] stride: you'd do that in c++ land and receive a callback when your heavy lifting is finished
[21:12] stride: (c++ land or a childprocess or a thread)
[21:12] monk12: could you also do it in JS land? like a 'offload' server.
[21:12] stride: nope, js land in node runs in a single thread, that's what makes it great :)
[21:12] stride: so consequently everything you do there will block other things
[21:13] stride: there's some stuff like fibers that you could use though, it's like a wrapper around the c++ stuff you'd have to take care of so you can stay in js land
[21:13] monk12: gotcha... well i think i was reading in this book 'node web development' that you could send it to a 'backend service' (but that would have to be another instance of node hehe)

[23:03] dre: Hello.  I have a node.JS application that I'm trying to bundle into node.  I figured out how to build it and get the _third_party_main to run for simple applications.  I can also put my supporting files into /lib and those work well as "native modules".  However, I'm not sure how to include any modules (as in, files from the folder node_modules), since everything in the /lib directory must be at the top level.  Is there any way to include mod
[23:03] dre: ules without having to flatten my project, rename conflicting files, etc.?

[23:06] Aria: File an issue!

[23:11] alystair: Hello all, looking for mentor that can help me out in learning to use node.js by making my own app. I know the super basics but could use advice as I go... I want to use mongodb, postgre or neo4j as my backend dbs (not under same app obviously)
[23:12] alystair: although finding a host for those DBs is a pain :/
[23:12] garann has joined the channel
[23:12] alystair: maybe I should be using AWS
[23:13] alystair: or heroku ~_~
[23:14] SubStack: alystair: nodejitsu has an api for spinning up hosted databases that's pretty great
[23:15] SubStack: or you can get hosted mongodb pretty easily
[23:15] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[23:15] SubStack: if you go the hosted couchdb route iris couch is pretty great too
[23:15] SubStack: npm runs on it
[23:15] alystair: I don't really like the premise of couchdb
[23:16] alystair: maybe once I have a better feel for making node apps
[23:16] dre: Anyone have any solutions for my question?  Is there no response because the question is complicated or because it's stupid?

[23:58] AvianFlu: you can also definitely get websockets working with nginx
[23:58] grom358: back*
[23:58] igl: you can let nginx do the static files and proxy thru to your node clusters
[23:58] AvianFlu: you used to have to recompile it, they may have fixed it outright by now
